# **Language & Communication**

### **Power and Impact of Language**

* Words are powerful; once spoken, they cannot be taken back—like arrows.
* Every spoken word leaves an impact on the listener’s mind and changes their perception of the world.

### **Diversity of Language**

* Approximately **7,000 languages** exist globally.
* Languages differ vastly:
  * Some have **20 vowel sounds**, others only **two**.
  * **Word order** varies:
    * **S-O-V** (e.g., Bengali, Turkish)
    * **S-V-O** (e.g., English)
    * **V-S-O** and other permutations also exist
  * **Sentence structure**:
    * Turkish packs information into **long compound words**.
    * Vietnamese uses **short words**, resulting in longer sentences.

### **Language Influencing Perception**

* **Colour terminology** varies across languages:
  * English uses **seven major colour names**.
  * Some languages have as few as **three**.
  * Yet, most distinguish between **dark/light** or **black/white**.
  * Order of colour naming tends to follow:
    1. Black/white
    2. Red
    3. Green or yellow
    4. Blue
* Colours like red are more vividly perceived—possibly affecting linguistic categorization.
* Experiments show:
  * Even if a language lacks a specific term, speakers can distinguish shades (e.g., red vs. orange).
  * Language may **facilitate faster recognition**, but doesn't limit perception.

### **Language Families and Shared Roots**

* Languages often share common ancestry and are grouped into **families**.
  * Example: **Indo-European family**
    * European languages (English, French, Italian, Spanish): derived from **Latin**.
    * Most Indian languages: derived from **Sanskrit**.

**Etymological Examples**:
* **Sanskrit vidya** ("knowledge") ← *vid* ("to perceive") ↔ Latin *videre* ("to see")  
  → Words: video, visual, divide, dividend
* **Sanskrit manas** ("mind") ↔ Latin *mens* ("to think")  
  → Word: mental
* **Sanskrit mrityu** ("death") ← *mri* ("to die") ↔ Latin *mori*  
  → Words: mortality, mortgage
* **Sanskrit kala** ("time") ← *kal* ("to count") ↔ Latin *calculare*  
  → Words: calculate, calendar
* **Latin gnatus** ("to be born") ↔ Sanskrit *jan*  
  → Words: cognate, janma, genus, generate, genocide

### **Language and Human Migration**

* Etymology can reveal traces of **ancient human migrations**.
* Words we use today carry **footprints of our ancestors**.

### **Language Structure and Grammar**

* **Morphology**: study of word composition using meaningful units.
* **Syntax**: study of sentence formation.
* Meaning types:
  * **Semantic** (literal)
  * **Pragmatic** (contextual)
* Meanings are often **layered** and **culturally shaped**.

### **Written vs. Spoken Language**

* All languages are fundamentally **spoken**; none exist only in written form.
* Scripts and writing styles vary:
  * Left to right / top to bottom vs. the opposite
* Regardless of script, all symbols are processed in the **fusiform gyrus**, near sound/vision areas.

### **Biological Basis of Language**

* Brain regions involved:
  * **Wernicke’s area**: comprehension
  * **Broca’s area**: speech production
* These regions show that **biology** underpins aspects of language.

### **Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis (Linguistic Determinism)**

* Proposed by **Benjamin Lee Whorf** and **Edward Sapir** in the 1940s.
* Suggests: **language determines thought content**.
* Example: **Hopi language** lacks past tense → Whorf claimed Hopi speakers may not conceptualize the past.
  * Hopi focus on **processes**, not temporal units.
  * English treats **time as quantifiable** (seconds, minutes, hours).
* View: **language, thought, and culture are intertwined**.

### **Linguistic Relativity**

* Strong version of Sapir-Whorf:
  * Language conditions the way we think.
  * Certain thoughts may be easier in some languages than others.
* **Wilhelm von Humboldt** (1835): “Language is the formative organ of thought.”
* However, testing this is nearly impossible; many conclusions have been contested or refuted.

**Criticisms & Limitations**
* Learning new languages disproves strict determinism.
* **Guy Deutscher** (“Through the Language Glass”, 2010) mocked it:
  > “Do English speakers who’ve never heard the German word *Schadenfreude* struggle to understand the concept of enjoying another’s misfortune?”
* Truth likely lies **between extremes** of determinism and universality.

### **Case Studies in Directional Language**

**Kuuk Thaayorre (Pormpuraaw, Australia)**
* Uses only **cardinal directions** (north, south, etc.), no "left/right/front/back".
* Even children have **precise directional sense**.

**Guugu Yimithirr (Australia)**
* Also uses cardinal directions exclusively:
  * “I left it on the southern edge of the western table.”
  * Describe actions with geographical precision (“coming northward”).
* Speakers retain **compass-like orientation** at all times.
* Guy Deutscher reports:
  * A **Tzeltal** speaker from Mexico, even blindfolded and spun, could accurately indicate cardinal directions.

### **Language, Gender, and Grammar**

* Languages encode gender differently:
  * English: no gender requirement in phrases like "my friend".
  * French/German: must specify gender (ami(m)/amie(f); Freund/Freundin).
  * English is **tense-specific**, while Chinese uses **same verb form** regardless of time.
* This doesn't mean people can't understand concepts like time or gender—just that they’re **linguistically encoded** differently.

### **Precision in Language (Matses, Peru)**

* Requires speakers to **report facts with certainty**.
  * Must say: “There were two wives last time I saw them,” unless currently verified.
* Promotes **attentiveness to factual accuracy** from childhood.

### **Experiments on Gender Perception in Language**

* **Mark Twain** mocked German for confusing gender:
  * A girl is *es* (neuter); a turnip is *sie* (feminine).
* Many believe **gender assignment** is arbitrary.
* However, experiments in the 1990s (German vs. Spanish):
  * German: bridge (*die Brücke*, feminine) → elegant, slender
  * Spanish: bridge (*el puente*, masculine) → strong, dangerous
  * Suggests **unconscious associations** tied to grammatical gender.

## **Babies Learn Language Even Earlier Than We Realized**  
**E. Altuntas, *Developmental Science*, Jan 2025**

### **Introduction: Babies as Language Detectives**
* Babies are constantly observing and processing their surroundings like little detectives.
* When a baby watches you speak, they’re not just hearing sounds—they’re learning how those sounds are physically produced.

### **New Discovery: Language Learning Begins Earlier Than Thought**
* A recent study published in *Developmental Science* reveals that:
  * **Language learning starts as early as four months old**.
  * This challenges previous beliefs that babies only begin learning sound patterns between 6–12 months of age.
* This finding opens up:
  * An **earlier window for intervention** for children at risk of speech or language delays.

### **Perceptual Attunement: Sorting Through a Buffet of Sounds**
* By age **one**, babies have started focusing on the sounds of their native language—a process called **perceptual attunement**.
* **Early Language Abilities (0–6 months):**
  * Babies can distinguish sounds from unfamiliar languages.
    * E.g., Hindi contrasts difficult for adult English speakers.
    * Unique tonal differences in Mandarin.
* **Narrowing Focus (6–12 months):**
  * Babies begin to tune out sounds they don’t hear often.
  * **Timeline:**
    * Around **6 months**: Vowels are fine-tuned.
    * Around **10 months**: Consonants are fine-tuned.
  * Babies focus on key native-language distinctions like:
    * The difference between **"r"** and **"l"** in English.

### **Revisiting Old Assumptions**
* Previous assumption:
  * Babies needed to narrow their perception first before learning **how sounds are made**.
* New finding from the study:
  * Babies as young as **four months** are already learning **articulatory features** (how sounds are physically formed):
    * Example: Knowing the difference between **"b"** (made with the lips) and **"d"** (made with the tongue tip).
  * This learning occurs **before** the narrowing process begins.

### **Conclusion**
* Babies demonstrate an **early sensitivity to speech production mechanisms**.
* These findings could have important implications for **early language development** and **intervention strategies**.

## **Complex Languages May Be More Efficient for Communication**  
**Alexander Koplenig et al, *PLOS Complex Systems* (2025)**

#### **1. Language Complexity and Communicative Efficiency**
* Languages with higher complexity tend to produce **shorter texts** to convey the same content.
* This reflects a **compensatory mechanism**, where:
  * Increased structural intricacy is offset by greater communicative efficiency.

### **2. Language, Gender, and Perception**
**Object Gender and Cognitive Associations**
* When speakers were asked to grade various objects (e.g., brooms, butterflies, keys, mountains):
  * **Spanish speakers** associated "masculine" objects (e.g., bridges, clocks, violins) with traits like **strength**.
  * **German speakers** described the same objects as **slender or elegant**.
  * For objects like mountains or chairs (masculine in German, feminine in Spanish), the effects were **reversed**.

**Voice Assignment Based on Grammatical Gender**
* When assigning human voices to objects:
  * **French speakers** chose female voices for a fork (*la fourchette* – feminine).
  * **Spanish speakers** chose male voices for a fork (*el tenedor* – masculine).

> This does not imply that speakers believe inanimate objects have biological sex.  
> Rather, viewing the world through grammatical gender may carry **emotional connotations**.

* Linguist **Guy Deutscher** questioned whether:
  * The **gender of "bridge"** in German vs. Spanish could influence **bridge design** in those countries.

> "We really do not know how the emotional maps imposed by a gender system affect tastes, habits and preferences." — *Guy Deutscher*

### **3. Time and Space in Language**
**Different Spatial-Temporal Gestures**
* In **Mandarin**:
  * Speakers point **past in the front** and **future at the back** when gesturing.
* In **English**:
  * We "look forward" to the future and "look back" at the past—opposite of Mandarin.
* In **Chinese thought**:
  * The past gives **strength to move ahead**.
  * The **uncertain future** is better left **behind**.

### **4. Language and Thought: Interdependent Systems**
**What is Thought?**
* Psychology defines **thinking** as:
  * A cognitive process involving **information processing, storage, and retrieval**.
* Thinking includes but is not limited to:
  * Forming **concepts**
  * Feeling **emotions** or **physical pain**
  * Engaging in **problem-solving**, **reasoning**, or **decision-making**

**The Language-Thought Connection**
* Key questions:
  * Can we **feel** a sensation without having a **word** for it?
  * Can there be **thought without concept**, or **concept without language**?
* Thinking may largely be **language-based**, but we also **think in images**.

> Experimentally, imagining a physical activity activates the **same brain regions** as actually performing it.

**Bidirectional Relationship**
* The interaction between language and thought is **not unidirectional**:
  * **Language ↔ Thought**  
  * Both are also shaped by **culture**.

> “There are intimate, complex relationships—the helical skein—between biology, culture, language, and thought.” — *Philip Lieberman*

* **Biology** sets **limits** on thought.
* **Culture** changes biology.
* **Language** transmits culture.
* **Culture** influences language and thought.

### **5. The Pirahã Case: Language Mirrors Culture**
**Everett’s Study on the Pirahã People**
* Linguist **Daniel Everett** studied the **Pirahã people** of the Amazon for 86 months.
* The Pirahã language **lacks recursion**:
  * Recursion = embedding of clauses (a feature regarded as **universal** in human language).
* Their lifestyle:
  * Based on **trust in nature**
  * Focuses on the **present moment**
  * No concept or need for **past** or **future**

**Cultural Simplicity Reflected in Language**
* Language features:
  * No words for **numbers** (only *few* and *many*)
  * No terms for **colors**
  * No **time markers** like week, month, or year
  * Uses **seasons** (wet/dry) as temporal references
* Language is used strictly as a **tool for daily life**, not a complex symbolic system.

### **6. The Mystery of Meaning in the Brain**
* Despite advances, we do **not fully understand**:
  * How **words and sentences** become **meaning** in the brain.
  * How the brain’s **neurons** translate language into **perception and thought**.

**Neurological Perspective**
* Neurons govern everything we:
  * **Perceive**, **think**, and **do**
* Yet, we can’t fully explain how:
  * Objects, events, ideas, sensations, or people are **encoded** in brain hardware.

### **7. Language as the Core of Human Distinction**
* Our **language and cognitive flexibility** set us apart from other primates.
* This flexibility has led to:
  * **Innovation**, **creativity**, and
  * The **diversity of ~7,000 languages** globally.

> We are still in the **infancy** of understanding the relationship between **language and thought**.

### **8. Philosophical Reflections on Language and Reality**
> “The only reality we can ever truly know is that of our perceptions, our own consciousness, while that consciousness, and thus our entire reality, is made of nothing but signs and symbols. Nothing but language. Even God requires language before conceiving the Universe. See Genesis: In the beginning was the Word.”  
> — *Alan Moore*, *Promethea*

## **Language Emerged 135,000 Years Ago**  
**Shigeru Miyagawa et al., Frontiers in Psychology (March, 2025)**

### Key Finding

* Based on genomic data about early human population divergence, **human language capacity must have been present by at least 135,000 years ago**, if not earlier.
* Shigeru Miyagawa states:  
  > "I think we can say with a fair amount of certainty that the first split occurred about 135,000 years ago, so human language capacity must have been present by then, or before."

### Basis of the Research

* The study conducts a **meta-analysis** of **15 genetic studies** published over the past 18 years:
  * **3 studies** analyzed inherited **Y chromosome** data.
  * **3 studies** examined **mitochondrial DNA**.
  * **9 studies** were **whole-genome** analyses.

* According to Miyagawa:
  > "Quantity-wise we have more studies, and quality-wise, it's a narrower window [of time]."

### Theoretical Implications

* Among the paper’s co-authors, **Ian Tattersall** is particularly noted for advancing the idea that:
  * **Language served as a kind of ignition** for:
    * **Symbolic thinking**
    * **Other organized human activities**
