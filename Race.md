## **BASES OF RACIAL CLASSIFICATION**

Racial classification has been a favourite subject of physical anthropologists since the beginning of the present century.

### **Types of Criteria Used for Racial Classification**

According to our syllabus, the criteria used for racial classification are:

* **Morphological**
* **Serological**
* **Genetic**

**Broad Classification of Criteria**

Thus, in reality, there are only **two major types** of criteria used for racial classification:

1. **Genetic**
2. **Morphological**

## Morphological Criteria for Racial Classification

### Overview of Morphological Criteria
* The **hereditary mechanism** of **morphological characteristics** in humans is complex.
* These criteria are **adaptive** in nature and influenced by the **environment**.
* Morphological criteria are divided into two types:
  * **Morphoscopic**: Characteristics that are visually observed (e.g., **eye shape**, **nose shape**, **eye colour**).
  * **Morphometric**: Characteristics that require measurement (e.g., **stature**).

### Commonly Used Morphological Criteria

**1. Cephalic Index**
* **Definition**: 
  > **Cephalic Index** = \(\frac{\text{Breadth of Head}}{\text{Length of Head}} \times 100\)
* **Significance**: The **Cephalic Index (C.I.)** is the earliest and most widely used criterion for **racial classification**.
* **Classifications**:
  * **Dolichocephal**: C.I. < 76.0 (associated with **Caucasoid** populations).
  * **Mesocephal**: C.I. 76.0–80.9.
  * **Brachycephal**: C.I. > 80 (associated with **Mongoloid** and **Negroid** populations).
* **Validity**: The use of **C.I.** for classifying populations into **Caucasoid**, **Negroid**, and **Mongoloid** groups justifies the importance of **morphological criteria**.

**2. Facial Index**
* **Definition**:
  > **Facial Index** = \(\frac{\text{Facial Length}}{\text{Facial Breadth}} \times 100\)
* **Characteristics**:
  * Broad faces are generally associated with **broad heads**, and narrow faces with **narrow heads**.
  * Females typically have **shorter and broader faces**.
* **Classifications**:
  * **Europrosopic**: < 84.0.
  * **Mesoprosopic**: 84.0–87.9.
  * **Leptoprosopic**: > 88.0.
* **Additional Notes**:
  * **Facial prognathism** and **alveolar prognathism** are also used in **morphological criteria**.
  * **Alveolar prognathism** is commonly found in **Negroid** populations.

**3. Nasal Index**
* **Definition**:
  > **Nasal Index** = \(\frac{\text{Nasal Breadth}}{\text{Nasal Length}} \times 100\)
* **Classifications**:
  * **Platyrrhine**: Broad and short nose (e.g., **African populations**, **Negroids**, **Negrito of South India**, **Australian aborigines**).
  * **Mesorrhine**: Medium nose (e.g., **Mongoloids**).
  * **Leptorrhine**: Narrow nose (e.g., **Caucasoids**).
* **Additional Features**:
  * **Root of the nose** (broad or narrow).
  * **Bridge of the nose** (pointed or blunt).
  * **Nasal septum** (directed downwards or upwards).
* **Significance**: The **nasal index** reflects the **adaptive mechanism** of populations during **evolution**.

**4. Eyes**
* **Mongoloid Eyes**:
  * Distinguished by the presence of **central**, **medial**, or **lateral epicanthic fold**.
* **Non-Mongoloid Eyes**:
  * Characterized as **wide open** and generally **straight**.

**5. Skin**
* **Influence**: **Skin colour** is easily influenced by the **environment** but remains significant for **population classification**.
* **Classifications**:
  * **Leucoderms**: White-skinned populations (e.g., **Europeans**, **Western Asiatics**, **North Africans**, **Polynesians**), ranging from **pinkish-white** to **light brown**.
  * **Xanthoderms**: Yellow-skinned populations (e.g., **Mongoloids**).
  * **Melanoderms**: Black-skinned populations (e.g., **Negroids**, **Papuans**, **Pre-Dravidians**).

**6. Hair**
* **Form**:
  * **Leiotrichous**: Smooth hair (e.g., **Mongoloids**).
  * **Cymotrichous**: Wavy or curly hair (e.g., **Caucasoids**).
  * **Ulotrichous**: Wooly or kinky hair (e.g., **Negroids**).
* **Colour**:
  * Varies from **blonde** (e.g., **Europeans**) to **dark brown** or **black**.
* **Texture**:
  * **Fine**: < 58.9 m.
  * **Medium**: 57–84.9 m (e.g., **Europeans**).
  * **Coarse**: > 85 m (e.g., **Chinese**, **Japanese**).

**7. Stature**
* **Variability**: **Stature** is highly variable and influenced by **environment**, **nutrition**, and other factors.
* **Adaptation**: In **high altitude areas**, **stature** tends to be shorter as an **adaptive mechanism**.
* **Haddon’s Scale for Classification**:
  * **Pygmy**: < 148.0 cm.
  * **Short**: 148.0–158.0 cm.
  * **Medium**: 158.0–168.0 cm.
  * **Tall**: 168.0–172.0 cm.
  * **Very Tall**: > 172.0 cm.
* **Significance**: **Stature** is a commonly used criterion for classifying **primary races**.

## Genetic Criteria for Racial Classification

### Overview of Serological Criteria
* **Blood groups** were first discovered in **1900**, but their use in studying **population differences** for **racial classification** began in the **third decade** of the 20th century.
* Compared to **morphological criteria**, **serological criteria** offer several advantages, as outlined by **W.C. Boyd**:
  > (i) They follow the **Mendelian principle** of inheritance.
  >
  > (ii) They are **discreet variables**.
  >
  > (iii) They are not easily influenced by the **environment**, and hence, are quite **stable**.
  >
  > (iv) They arose quite during **human evolution**.

### Classification Based on Serological Criteria
* **W.C. Boyd** classified humanity into **six races** based on **serological criteria**:
  * **Early Europeans** (represented by **Borsque**)
  * **Europeans**
  * **Africans**
  * **Asiatic**
  * **Amerinds**
  * **Australoids**
* **Limitations**: This classification had **too many flaws** to be widely accepted.
* Other notable contributors to the use of **blood groups** as **racial characteristics** include:
  * **Mourant et al.**
  * **Race and Sanger**

### Commonly Used Blood Group Systems
* The most widely used system for **racial classification** is the **ABO blood group**.
* Additional blood group systems include:
  * **MNSS**
  * **Rh (CcDEe)**
  * **Kell**
  * **P**
  * **Duffy**
  * **Celano**

### Challenges in Research
* Most **developing countries** lack facilities for advanced research on **serological criteria**, limiting the clarity and scope of findings.

### Insights from ABO Blood Group Studies
* **Mutation Origins**:
  * The mutation for **blood group A** occurred in **Europe**.
  * The mutation for **blood group B** occurred in **Asia** (specifically **India**).
* **Frequency and Environment**:
  * The higher frequency of **blood group A** in **Europe** and **blood group B** in **Asia** can be understood due to their **adaptive advantages** in specific **environments**.

## Distribution of Blood Groups

### Overview of ABO Blood Group Distribution
* The most comprehensive data on **gene distribution** pertains to the **ABO blood groups**.
* Global frequency estimates for **ABO blood group genes**:
  * **G<sup>a</sup>**: 62.3 percent
  * **G<sup>b</sup>**: 21.5 percent
  * **G<sup>o</sup>**: 16.2 percent
* **Regional variations**: Frequencies vary significantly across different regions, complicating **racial classification**.

### Regional Patterns of G<sup>o</sup> Gene Distribution
* **American Indians**:
  * In some areas, populations are almost entirely **G<sup>o</sup>**, with minimal **G<sup>a</sup>** or **G<sup>b</sup>**.
  * **G<sup>o</sup>** is prevalent among **indigenous Amerindians**, including **Eskimos**, though **Eskimos** have higher frequencies of **A** and **B**.
* **Western Europe**:
  * **G<sup>o</sup>** is common but drops to its lowest frequency (around 40–50 percent) in **Central Asia**.
* **Mongoloid Grouping**:
  * **Asiatics** and **Amerindians** are traditionally classified as **Mongoloid**, despite differing **G<sup>o</sup>** frequencies.
  * This discrepancy highlights challenges in creating clear-cut **racial divisions** based on **blood group alleles**.

### Distribution of G<sup>b</sup> Gene
* **Pattern**:
  * The **G<sup>b</sup> gene** distribution is generally the inverse of **G<sup>o</sup>**.
  * It is relatively common in **Central Asia** but rare among **indigenous populations of America**.
* **Cline**:
  * A steady decrease in **G<sup>b</sup>** frequency occurs from **Central Asia** to **Western Europe**.
  * The lowest **G<sup>b</sup>** frequency is found in the **Basque population**, where **G<sup>o</sup>** is very high.
* **Basque Population**:
  * Characterized by:
    * High **G<sup>o</sup>** frequency.
    * Low **G<sup>b</sup>** frequency.
    * High frequencies of **Rh negative genes**.
    * A distinctive **non-Indo-European language**.

### Other Populations with Similar Patterns
* Populations in **Western Europe** (e.g., **Ireland**) also show:
  * Low **G<sup>b</sup>** frequencies.
  * High **G<sup>o</sup>** frequencies.

### Challenges in Racial Classification
* The varied distribution of **blood group alleles** (e.g., **G<sup>o</sup>** and **G<sup>b</sup>**) underscores the difficulty of defining **racial categories**.
* While there is some correlation between **blood group allele distribution** and **major racial groupings**, exceptions (e.g., **Mongoloid** classification) demonstrate the complexity of **racial classification**.## Distribution of Blood Groups

## Dermatoglyphics and Criteria for Racial Classification

### Introduction to Dermatoglyphics
* **Scientific studies** on **dermal patterns** began at the turn of the last century.
* **Dermatoglyphics** are an important set of criteria for **racial classification**.
* Studies on **finger ball sets**, **toes**, **palms**, and **soles** have enabled the classification of populations that could not be classified otherwise.

### Dermatoglyphic Patterns by Population
### Finger Ball Patterns
* **Types**: **Arches**, **loops**, and **whorls**.
* **Caucasoids**:
  * Exhibit the highest frequency of **loops**.
* **Mongoloids**:
  * Predominantly have **whorls**.
  * Very low frequency (1–2%) of **arches**.

### Palmar Main Line Formulae
* **Caucasoids**:
  * Commonly associated with the formula **11, 9, 7**.
* **Negroids**:
  * Represented by the formula **7, 5, –**.
* **Mongoloids**:
  * Excel in the formula **9, 7, 5, –**.

**Diagram Reference**: A hand with labeled **palmar dermatoglyphics regions**: **a, b, c, d, A, B, C, D, T, t**.

### Additional Criteria for Racial Classification
* Other traits used for **racial classification** include:
  * **Secretor status**
  * **Tasting ability**

### Evaluation of Criteria for Racial Classification
**Morphological Criteria**
* **Initial Perception**:
  * **Morphological criteria** appear excellent for **racial classification** because:
    * They are easy to **notice** or **measure**.
    * Numerous **morphological characters** can be used, enabling comprehensive classification.
* **Limitations**:
  * **Morphological traits** do not meet the standards for reliable **racial classification**:
    > (i) The **mode of inheritance** of the criterion should be known.
    >
    > (ii) The trait must not be easily influenced by the **environment**.
    >
    > (iii) Demarcations between variations of a single trait should be **clear** (i.e., the criterion should be a **discrete variable**, not a **continuous variable**).
  * Issues with **morphological traits**:
    * Their **mode of inheritance** is unclear.
    * They are strongly influenced by the **environment**.
    * Most are not **discrete variables**.
  * **Conclusion**: **Morphological traits** are not reliable for **racial classification**.

**Genetic Criteria**
* **Advantages**:
  * **Genetic traits** fulfill the three conditions for reliable **racial classification**:
    * Known **mode of inheritance**.
    * Minimal influence from the **environment**.
    * **Discrete variables**.
  * Additional benefits make **genetic traits** appear ideal for **racial classification**.
* **Limitations**:
  * In reality, **genetic traits** cannot classify mankind into **races**.
  * **Races** do not exist on a **genetic basis**.
* **Example**: **Hb-S gene** (sickle cell gene):
  * Provides resistance against **malaria**.
  * Found in high frequency among **Negroid populations** in **Central and East Africa**, where **malarial environments** are prevalent.
  * In these populations, many adults are **heterozygous** for the **Hb-S gene**.
  * Outside **Central and East Africa**, the **Hb-S gene** is not significant in other **Negroid populations**.
  * **Conclusion**: The distribution of **genetic traits** like **Hb-S** is driven by **natural selection**, not **race**.

### Challenges in Racial Classification
* No criterion is fully reliable for **racial classification** because **pure races** do not exist.
* **Human variation** is **dynamic**, not static, making fixed **racial categories** impractical.
* **Genetic similarities** among humans far outweigh **racial differences**:
  * All humans belong to a **single species** and share a **common stock**.
  * Populations differ **quantitatively** in **gene frequency**, not in the **kind of genes**.
  * **Segregation** and **recombination** in human populations make classification by **genotypes** the only complete approach.

### UNESCO Statement on Race
* The **UNESCO Statement on Race** emphasizes:
  > The differences between various **human populations** are not **absolute** but are in **degree** only, and higher or lower **frequency of a trait** in a population has no reflection on the **capabilities** of its subjects.

## UNESCO Statement on Race (1964) and Racial Differences

### UNESCO Statement on Race (1964)
The **UNESCO Statement on Race (1964)** outlines key principles regarding **human races** and **biological diversity**:

1. **Common Origin**:
   > All men living today belong to one species, **Homo sapiens**, and are derived from a **common stock**.

2. **Non-Existence of Pure Races**:
   > **Pure races** do not exist in the human species.

3. **Intra-Race Variability**:
   > Differences between individuals within a **race** are often greater than the average differences between **races**.

4. **No Biological Superiority or Inferiority**:
   > From the **biological point of view**, it is not possible to speak of a general **inferiority** or **superiority** of a **race**.

5. **Incomparability to Animal Races**:
   > **Human races** cannot be compared at all to **races of domestic animals**.

6. **Interbreeding Safety**:
   > It has never been proved that **interbreeding** between **races** has **biological disadvantages** for mankind as a whole.

7. **Marriage and Genetics**:
   > The **biological consequences** of a marriage depend only on **individual genetic make up** of the couple and not on their **race**.

8. **No Prohibition on Inter-Marriage**:
   > No **biological justification** exists for prohibiting **inter-marriage** between persons of different **races**.

9. **Race as a Biological Concept**:
   > There is no **national**, **religious**, **geographic**, **linguistic**, or **cultural group** which constitutes a **race ipso facto**; the concept of **race** is purely **biological**.

10. **Equal Biological Potential**:
    > The people of the world today appear to possess **equal biological potentialities** for attaining any **civilizational level**.

11. **No Inferior or Superior Races**:
    > Concerning the overall **intelligence** and the **capacity for cultural development**, there is no justification for the concept of “**Inferior**” and “**Superior**” **races**.

12. **Rejection of Racist Theories**:
    > The **biological data** stand in open contradiction to the tenets of **racism**. **Racist theories** can in no way pretend to have any **scientific foundation**, and the **anthropologists** should endeavour to prevent the results of their **researches** from being used in such a **biased way** that they would serve **non-scientific ends**.

### Understanding Racial Differences
* **Environmental Adaptation**:
  * **Researches** have shown that different people today are the results of their respective **environments**.
  * All populations have survived in varied **environments** due to **separate adaptive strategies** followed in the past.
* **Origin of Racial Differences**:
  * Today’s **racial differences** are solely the result of **adaptation** and have no bearing on **capacities** and **capabilities** for **culture**.

## Role of Heredity and Environment in Race Formation

### Understanding Heredity
* **Definition**: **Heredity** refers to the **genetic composition** of an individual or group, encompassing all **biological traits** and **parameters**.
* **Significance**:
  * Studying **heredity** is vital for understanding **gene frequencies** in different populations.
  * It allows analysis of **gene migration** processes.
  * It helps investigate **susceptibility** to **genetic diseases** and their impact on **gene frequencies**.

### Understanding Environment
* **Definition**: **Environment** includes all non-genetic factors, such as **climate**, **vegetation**, **nutrition**, and more.
* **Historical Context**:
  * The **environment** has never been static, with frequent changes in **climates**, **flora**, and **fauna**.
  * Recent human **evolution** has led to significant **artificial changes** caused by human activity.

### Interplay of Heredity and Environment in Race Formation
* **Formation of Heredity**:
  * **Heredity** is a component of an individual’s **genetic composition**.
  * A mismatch can occur when an individual with a specific **genetic composition** lives in an incompatible **environment**.
* **Case Study: Hemoglobin Genotypes and Malaria**:
  * **Malaria** is an **environmental disease**, while **hemoglobin type** is determined by an individual’s **genetic make-up**.
  * **HbA/HbA (Normal Hemoglobin) Homozygotes**:
    * Cannot survive in **malaria-infested environments** due to persistent **malaria attacks**, which reduce **immunity**.
  * **HbS/HbS (Sickle Cell) Homozygotes**:
    * Cannot survive due to loss of **oxygen-carrying capacity**.
  * **HbA/HbS Heterozygotes**:
    * Best suited to survive in **malaria-infested environments** due to balanced **genetic adaptation**.

### Environmental Influence on Genotypic Structure
* **Selective Pressure**:
  * Specific **genotypes** are either **favoured** or **disfavoured** by different **environments**.
  * **Favoured genotypes** spread rapidly, while **disfavoured genotypes** gradually lose prevalence.
* **Direct Impact**:
  * **Environment** directly influences the **genotypic structure** of populations.
* **Micro-Evolutionary Processes**:
  * The relationship between **environment** and **heredity** is best understood through **micro-evolutionary processes**, which drive **genotypic changes** over time.
