# Biological Evolution

**Definition:**

* Evolution, in simple terms, means:

  * "Change in progressive direction"
  * "Change with modification"
  * "Change and adaptation"

**Genetic Perspective:**

* Evolution refers specifically to **change in gene frequencies** over time.

## **Historical Contributions to Evolutionary Thought**

### **Pre-Darwinian Thinkers**

Though **Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection** is widely regarded as the first scientific theory of evolution, **he was not the first to consider progression in nature**.

**Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778)**

* Authored *Systema Naturae*
* First to divide various plant and animal species into groups
* Based groupings on observed **similarities and differences** between species

**Georges Cuvier (1769–1832)**

* Known as the **father of comparative anatomy**
* Studied bones of extinct animals
* Proposed the theory of **Catastrophism**, stating:

  > "Catastrophism resulted in the destruction of old species and new ones came up."

**James Hutton (1726–1797)**

* Wrote *Theory of the Earth* (1788)
* Observed that:

  > "The landmasses of the earth were not static and they, because of a number of factors, keep changing."

**Charles Lyell (1797–1875)**

* Authored *Principles of Geology*
* Provided strong evidence for the **evolution of the earth's crust**
* Greatly influenced scientific thought on geological and biological evolution

### **Theories of Evolution**

**Jean-Baptiste Lamarck**

* Proposed the **theory of evolution through adaptation**
* Gained wide acclaim in his time

**Charles Darwin**

* Built upon previous ideas with his comprehensive explanation of **natural selection**
* Firmly established the process of **evolution through natural selection** as a scientific theory

---

# **Lamarckism**

### **Overview**

* **Lamarck** synthesized various pre-existing ideas on organic evolution into a cohesive theory.
* He proposed that **evolution results from the constant striving of living beings** toward **perfect adaptation** to environmental conditions.
* According to Lamarck:

  * Living beings possess "internal forces of life" enabling them to **modify their physiological structure** during their lifetime.
  * These **"acquired changes" are inheritable**, passed on to subsequent generations.
  * The **diversity of life forms** is the result of the accumulation of such gradual changes over long periods.

---

## **Lamarck’s Four Laws of Evolution**

Outlined in *Philosophie Zoologique* (1809—the same year Darwin was born):

1. **Internal Growth by Life Forces**

   > "Life, by its proper forces, continually tends to increase the volume of every body which possesses it, and to increase the size of its parts, up to a limit which brings it about; in short, all living organisms grow due to the 'internal forces of life'."

2. **Origin of Organs from Need**

   > "The production of a new organ in the living body results from the supervention of a new want which continues to make itself felt, and a new movement which this want gives rise to and maintains."

   * This implies **new organs arise from persistent needs**.

3. **Use and Disuse Principle**

   > "The development of organs and their powers of action are constantly in ratio to the employment of these organs."

   * **Use leads to growth**; **disuse leads to degeneration**.

4. **Inheritance of Acquired Characters**

   > "Everything which has been acquired, impressed upon, or changed in the organisation of individuals during the course of their life is preserved by heredity and transmitted to the next generation."

* The **fourth law**, which proposes the **inheritance of acquired characters**, is the most controversial. This is commonly referred to as the **Lamarckian doctrine**.

---

## **Critical Appraisal of Lamarck's Theory**

### 1. **Size Increase in Organisms**

* Lamarckism claims that internal forces cause living organisms to **increase in size** over time.
* While it's true that **larger species may descend from smaller ones**, it's not a universal rule:

  * **Example:** Humans evolved from **small primates** in the Eocene.
  * **Counter-example:** The **extinction of large dinosaurs** contradicts the idea that species always grow larger.

### 2. **Appearance of New Organs**

* Modern understanding shows that **new organs do not emerge simply from need**:

  * **Example:** Despite humanity's long desire to fly, humans have never evolved **wings**.

### 3. **Use and Disuse**

* This principle holds **partial truth**:

  * **Positive cases:** An **athlete** can develop leg muscles; mental effort may enhance **wisdom**.
  * **Limits:** Overexertion can result in **harm**, both physically and mentally:

    > "If you run more than you can or tax your brain beyond limit, you will be a looser."

### 4. **Inheritance of Acquired Characters**

* Widely discredited:

  * A person who **loses legs** in an accident **still has children with normal legs**.
  * Despite a **2,000-year-old tradition** of Indian women piercing ears and noses, **children are not born with pierced ears or noses**.
  * This principle **"brought the doom of Lamarck's theory"**.
  * The theory lacks **convincing evidence and data** to support its claims.

## **Conclusion: Lamarck’s Legacy**

* Despite **severe criticisms**, Lamarck's contributions remain significant:

  * He introduced his theory during a period when even the **mention of "evolution"** was socially and academically **rebellious**.
  * Lamarck faced **ostracism** for "deliberately misinterpreting the facts."
  * His work **sparked interest** in the study of evolution and **paved the way for modern scientific theories** on the subject.

# **Darwinism**

**Definition:**

* **Darwinism** may be defined as a **causo-mechanical** (hence **not teleologic**) explanation of the origin of new species.
* This explanation is based on:

  * **Observed facts**
  * **Inferred facts** derived from those observations

---

### **I. Observed Facts**

1. **Geometrical Increase of Population**

   > "The increase by multiplication in geometrical ratio of the individuals in every species, whatever the kinds of reproduction which may be peculiar to each species."

   * Despite high fecundity, the total population of species remains **roughly constant** over generations.

2. **Variations**

   > "The always apparent slight (to greater) variation in form and function existing among all individuals even though of the same generation or breed."

3. **Heredity**

   > "The transmission, (with these inevitable slight variations) by the parents (to the off-springs) of a form and physiology essentially like the parents."

---

### **II. Inferred Facts**

1. **Competition for Resources**

   > "A lack of room and food for all these new individuals produced by geometrical multiplication and consequently a competition, (active or passive) among those individuals having any ecological relations to one another."

   * Examples: Competing for **space**, **food**, or being part of each other's **food chain**.

2. **Survival of the Advantageous**

   > "The probable success in this competition of those individuals whose slight differences (variations) are of such a nature as to give them an advantage over their confreres..."

   * Those with advantageous traits are more likely to survive **at least until reproduction**.

3. **Inheritance of Advantageous Traits**

   > "These 'saved' individuals will, by virtue of the action of heredity, hand down to the off-springs their advantageous conditions of structure and physiology..."

---

### **III. The Struggle for Existence**

Darwinian competition among individuals and species is referred to as a **struggle**, which can take various forms:

A. **Types of Struggles**

1. **Intraspecific Struggle (Within the Same Species)**

   > "An active struggle or competition with other individuals of its own kind for space in the habitat, sufficient share of food, and opportunity to produce off-springs..."

2. **Interspecific Struggle (Between Different Species)**

   > "An active or passive struggle or competition with the individuals of other species which may need the same space and food... or may need it or its eggs or young for food."

3. **Struggle Against Environmental Conditions**

   > "An active (or more usually passive) struggle with the physico-chemical external conditions of the world it lives in..."

   * Examples: **Temperature**, **humidity**, **storms**, **floods**, **natural catastrophes**

B. **Temporary Relief from Struggles**

Some individuals may experience **reduced struggle**, such as:

* **Altruistic social structure**:

  > "...intraspecific struggle among the thousands of honeybee individuals living together altruistically, in one hive."

* **Symbiosis**:

  > "...inter-specific struggle, when two species live together symbiotically as the hermit crab (*Eupagurus*) and sea-anemone (*Podocoryne*)."

* **Favorable climates**:

  > "...struggle against untoward natural conditions as in special times or places of highly favourable climate..."

However, for many others, **all forms of struggle may be active and severe**.

---

### **IV. Fitness and Reproductive Success**

* **Survival alone is not success**.

* True success is defined as:

  > "Contribution to the next generation."

* Fitness is measured by:

  * **Traits that aid survival**
  * **Traits that enhance fertility**

> "Individuals contributing the most offsprings to the next generation are the 'fittest' ones."

---

### **V. Natural Selection and Evolution**

* Darwin and his followers argue that **natural selection** is the inevitable outcome of these conditions.

> "Thousands must die where some may live to maturity (at least up to the time of producing young)..."

* Those who survive do so because of:

  * **Slight but advantageous congenital differences (variations)**
  * These traits are then passed on to offspring.

* Conversely:

  > "The 'rest' with unfortunate congenital variations are extinguished... and with them the opportunity for the perpetuation... of their particular variations."

* As offspring continue to vary around the newly selected traits, this leads to:

> "...a slow but steady and certain modification through the successive generations of the form and functions of the species..."

### Direction of Modification:

* Always toward:

  * **Adaptation**
  * **Fitness**
  * **Conformity with external conditions**

> "The exquisite adaptation of the parts and functions of the animal and plants... has all come to exist through the purely mechanical, inevitable weeding out and selecting by nature..."

---

### **VI. Conclusion: The Core of Darwinism**

> "This is Darwin's causo-mechanical theory to explain the transformation of species and the infinite variety of adaptive modification."

* **Natural Selection**, rigorous and automatic, is:

  > "...the essential idea of Darwinism at least in Darwinism as it is held by the present day followers of Darwin."

---

## **Microevolution**

### **1. Definition and Nature of Evolution**

* **Evolution** is defined as:

  * A **change in genetic material**.
  * Or more conveniently, a **change in gene frequencies**.

* **Heredity** attempts to maintain continuity by passing traits over generations:

  * It is essentially **static**.
  * If heredity were **omnipotent**, evolution would not occur.

> *“But none of the so-called hereditary traits is absolutely hereditary.”*

### **2. Gene-Environment Interaction**

* **Genes express themselves in response to the environment**.
* There is a **constant interaction** between:

  * **Hereditary features** and
  * **Environmental changes**.
* As the **environment changes**, genes must **also adapt** to express themselves.

> *“Records are available to show that the genes that failed to change with changing environment are eliminated.”*

* For genes to **survive and propagate**, they must adapt:

  * This **adaptive change** constitutes **evolution**.

### **3. Types of Evolution**

* The study of evolution is divided into:

  * **Microevolution**
  * **Macroevolution**
  * *(Megaevolution is also proposed by some biologists, but is not relevant here.)*

**Microevolution**

* Refers to **change within a species**.
* A **species** is defined as:

  * A group of individuals capable of **interbreeding** to produce **fertile offspring**.
* Characteristics:

  * **Small-scale, day-to-day changes**.
  * Observable in **living populations**.

> *“Man is one species because any man can marry any woman (at least theoretically) without threatening the existence of his race.”*

**Macroevolution**

* Refers to **evolutionary change that leads to the formation of a new species**.
* Studied through **discontinuous populations**.
* Example:

  * The change from **Homo erectus to Homo sapiens**.
  * Mating between an **ass and a mare** produces a **mule** (infertile), indicating horse and donkey are different species.

### **4. Conceptual Clarification**

> *“This dichotomy has been devised for our convenience, otherwise there is no difference between micro and macro evolution.”*

* In nature, there is **no actual separation** between micro and macroevolution.
* Evolution is **continuous**, occurring through various **microevolutionary processes**.

### **5. Microevolutionary Processes**

**Microevolution** is not a single process but an **aggregate of multiple interacting factors**, known as **microevolutionary processes**:

* **Mutation**
* **Natural Selection**
* **Inbreeding**
* **Hybridization**
* **Genetic Drift**

---

## **Mutation**

### **1. Types of Mutation**

Mutations are broadly classified into two main types:

* **Somatic Mutations**

  * Occur in body (somatic) cells.
  * **Not inherited**.
  * Not consequential in evolution.

* **Germinal Mutations**

  * Occur in germ cells.
  * **Can be inherited**.
  * Subdivided into:

    * **Chromosomal Mutations**

      * Lead to **gross alterations in chromosomes**.
      * Discussed later under the section on changes in chromosome number.
    * **Point Mutations** (also known as **gene mutations**)

      * Alter the **functioning of a single gene**.
      * **Only source** of **new traits in humans**.
      * Genetic recombination does **not qualify** as a point mutation as it does not alter gene structure.

> *The discussion on mutation, from this point onwards, refers exclusively to point mutations.*

### **2. Nature of Mutations**

* **Mutation** refers to **any sudden change** in genetic material.
* They are **random** and do **not arise to fulfill any need**.
* Mutations are **unrelated** to environmental demands or experiences.

> *“They do not arise to fulfill a need, instead they are totally random.”*

### **3. Impact of Mutations**

**On Individuals**

* **Most mutations** reduce **viability** and **fertility**.
* They are usually **deleterious** because:

  * Genetic material is already **highly adapted**.
  * Any random change is likely to **reduce adaptive fitness**.

**On Populations**

* While **advantageous mutations** are **rare**, many mutations are **neutral**.
* Neutral mutations:

  * Neither help nor harm the individual.
  * **Crucial for long-term survival** of species.
  * **Increase genetic variability**, enhancing adaptability to environmental changes.

> *“Higher the variability in the gene pool of the population, greater will be its capacity to withstand environmental change.”*

* Despite being often harmful to individuals, **mutations are essential for population survival**.

> *“It must be kept in mind that ultimately it is the environment acting through the process of natural selection, that decides whether a particular mutation is harmful or not.”*

### **4. Characteristics of Mutations**

* **Spontaneous vs. Induced**
  * **Spontaneous mutations** are **relevant** for evolutionary mechanisms.
  * **Induced mutations** can occur but are less significant evolutionarily.
* **Permanence and Reversibility**
  * Mutations are **somewhat permanent**.
  * Mutated genes can undergo:
    * Second mutations
    * Third mutations
    * Even **reverse mutations**
* **Mutation Rate**
  * Mutation is **sudden**, but the **rate of genetic change is slow**.
  * Evidence often comes from **family studies** and **pedigree analysis** (especially in laboratory conditions).

### **5. Detection of Mutations**

**Dominant Mutations**

* Easily recorded.
* Instantly **produce new phenotypes**.

**Recessive Mutations**

* Harder to detect:
  * Do **not express phenotypically** unless **homozygous**.
  * Express more often in:
    * **Small, inbred populations**
    * **Consanguineous marriages**
* **Recessive X-linked Mutations**
  * Express only in **descendant males**.
  * Example:

    > *“We can, for example, be almost sure that the Queen Victoria must have inherited the gene for haemophilia through female line only as none of her male ancestors contracted it while some of her male descendants did.”*
* **Physiological vs. Morphological Effects**
  * Most mutations show **phenotypic expression**.
  * Mutations involving **physiological systems** and **metabolism** may not show **morphological alterations**.

### **6. Causes of Mutation**

**Physical and Chemical Agents**

* **Radiation (most potent mutagenic agent)**:
  * Deep-penetrating ionizing radiation:
    * X-rays
    * Gamma rays
    * Cosmic rays (< 10⁻⁸ cm wavelength)
    * Neutrons from nuclear reactors
* **Chemical Mutagens**:
  * Aldehydes
  * Nitrogenous compounds
  * Acids
  * Carcinogens
  * Sulphur compounds
* **Temperature**:
  * Not known to cause mutations in humans.

> *“Studies have shown that radiations may cause mutation by the production of certain chemicals.”*

**Target Specificity**

* Mutagens act **only on the cells** they directly contact.
* **Species specificity**:
  * Mutagens effective in plants may not affect humans.
  * Human chemical metabolism **breaks down chemicals** before reaching cells.

* **Specificity of Mutagenic Agents**:
  * Radiation: **non-specific** (affects many genes).
  * Some chemicals: **gene-specific**.

> *“This is why mutations are not as common as these could have been.”*
