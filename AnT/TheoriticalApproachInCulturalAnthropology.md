# **Theoretical Approaches in Cultural Anthropology**

## **1. The Practice of Fieldwork in Anthropology**

* Anthropologists have been living in other societies for nearly a century.
* Initially, only a few adventurous (or foolhardy) individuals undertook this task.
* Over time, participation increased as more people became interested in:
  * Spending a year or more in distant locations.
  * Living without the comforts of home.
  * Learning how others live and think.
* The primary goal:
  > “To add to our knowledge so that we might someday come to understand how human cultural behavior could vary so much and yet be so much the same at different times and in different places.”

## **2. The Data Bank of Cultural Variation**

* Approximately **2,000 societies** have been described to some extent in anthropological literature.
* This body of work forms an **enormous wealth of information**, serving as a:
  * **Data bank** of **cultural variation**.
* Understanding cultural similarities and differences requires:
  * More than inspection of data.
  * Clear **theoretical guidance** on what to focus on.

## **3. Importance of Focus in Anthropological Study**

* Like photographers who must aim and focus a camera:
  * **Anthropologists must concentrate** on what they deem important.
  * This allows them to **describe** and potentially **explain** specific cultural aspects.
* Even the most thorough observer must:
  * Focus on **certain aspects of life**.
  * Inevitably **neglect others**.

## **4. Influences on Anthropological Focus**

Anthropologists’ focus is typically shaped by:

* **Theoretical orientation**:
  * A **general attitude** on how cultural phenomena should be explained.
* **Subject interest**.
* **Preferred method of research**.

## **5. Theoretical Orientations in Cultural Anthropology**

* This chapter explores:
  * **Major theoretical orientations** in cultural anthropology.
  * **Recent schools of thought** that define themselves by:
    * **Subject interests**
    * **Research methods**

## **6. Categorization of Anthropologists**

* Not all anthropologists fit neatly into a single category.
* However, general labels help describe different explanatory styles, including:
  * **Evolutionary anthropologist**
  * **Postmodernist**
  * **Cultural ecologist**
  * **Feminist anthropologist**

These labels provide a useful framework for discussing the **diverse styles of explanation** used in the field.

# **History of Theoretical Orientations**

## **1. The Dynamic Nature of Anthropological Theory**

* In **anthropology**, as in all academic disciplines, there exists a:
  * **Continual ebb and flow of ideas**.
* A **theoretical orientation** may:
  * Rise in prominence.
  * Be **challenged or replaced** by a new orientation.
* Typically, a new orientation:
  * Highlights **aspects of a problem** that the previous orientation either **ignored** or **minimized**.

## **2. Historical Sequence of Theoretical Orientations**

* The discussion follows an **approximate historical sequence**.
* Each school of thought will be examined in terms of:
  * The **kinds of information** or **phenomena** it emphasizes as **explanatory factors**.

## **3. Continuity and Change in Theoretical Schools**

* Some theoretical orientations have:
  * **Passed into history**.
* Others:
  * **Continue to attract adherents** and maintain relevance in contemporary anthropology.

---

# **Early Evolutionism**

## **1. General Premise**

* In the early years of **anthropology**, the dominant belief was:
  * Culture **develops (or evolves)** in a **uniform and progressive manner**.
  * Most societies were thought to pass through the **same series of stages**, ending at a **common outcome**.
* **Culture change** was considered:
  * **Internally determined**, with sources of change embedded from the beginning.

## **2. Key Theorists: Edward B. Tylor and Lewis Henry Morgan**

### **Edward B. Tylor (1832–1917)**

* Proposed that **culture evolved** from **simple to complex**.
* Societies were believed to pass through **three basic stages**:
  1. **Savagery**
  2. **Barbarism**
  3. **Civilization**
* Believed that:
  > “Progress” was therefore possible for all.

* Cultural variation was explained as:
  * Different societies being at **different stages** of evolution.
  * **Simpler societies** resembled **ancient societies**, while:
    * More **advanced societies** demonstrated cultural evolution via **survivals**.

#### **Example of a Survival (Tylor’s concept):**

> Earlier peoples made cooking pots from clay;
> Today we usually use metal for durability,
> Yet we still prefer dishes made from clay.

* Advocated the idea of **psychic unity** of mankind:
  > “Because of the basic similarities common to all peoples, different societies often find the same solutions to the same problems independently.”
* Also acknowledged **diffusion**:
  * Traits can spread between societies through **contact** and **borrowing**.

### **Lewis Henry Morgan (1818–1881)**

* A lawyer interested in the **Iroquois Indians**.
* Authored *Ancient Society*, in which he theorized about:
  * **Sequences in cultural evolution**, particularly of the **family unit**.

#### **Six Stages of Family Evolution (Morgan’s Hypothesis):**

1. **Horde living in promiscuity** (no prohibitions, no family structure)
2. **Group marriage with sibling mating allowed**
3. **Group marriage** (no sibling mating)
4. **Loosely paired male and female**, still living communally
5. **Husband-dominant family** (polygyny)
6. **Monogamous family** (husband and wife relatively equal)

* Believed families became **smaller and more self-contained** over time.

#### **Modern Evaluation of Morgan’s Theory:**

* His sequence is **not supported** by ethnographic evidence:

  > “No recent society generally practices group marriage or allows brother–sister mating.”

## **3. Influence on Marxist Theory**

* **Karl Marx** saw parallels between Morgan’s work and his own historical materialism.
* With **Friedrich Engels**, Marx developed a theory where:
  * **Monogamy**, **private property**, and **the state** were key to **class exploitation**.
* They extended Morgan’s scheme to predict a **future evolutionary stage**:
  > A return to the **“communism” of primitive society**, where these institutions would no longer exist.

## **4. Modern Critique of Early Evolutionism**

* The views of Tylor, Morgan, and other 19th-century thinkers are:
  * **Largely rejected** today.

### **Main Criticisms:**

* Theories fail to explain:
  * **Cultural variation**:
    > “Psychic unity of mankind” cannot account for diversity.
  * Why some societies **regressed** or became **extinct**.
  * Why some societies reached “civilization” **without passing through all stages**.

* Overall, early evolutionist theories:
  * Cannot **adequately explain** the **details of cultural evolution and variation** as understood in modern anthropology.

---

# **Diffusionism**

## **1. Emergence and Historical Context**

* **Late 19th to early 20th century**: Diffusionism gained popularity while **cultural evolutionism** (e.g., Tylor and Morgan) was still influential.
* Major **diffusionist schools** emerged in:
  * **Britain**
  * **Germany-Austria**
  * **United States**

## **2. British School of Diffusionism**

### **Key Figures**:

* **G. Elliot Smith**
* **William J. Perry**
* **W\.H.R. Rivers**

### **Main Claims**:

* **Egypt** was the source of most aspects of **higher civilization**, due to its early development of **agriculture**.
* Cultural traits were **diffused globally** as other societies came into **contact with Egyptians**.

* **Parallel, independent evolution** of traits was considered:

  > "Extremely rare."

* **People were seen as**:

  > “Inherently uninventive” and more inclined to **borrow inventions** than develop their own.

### **Reception**:

* This viewpoint was **never widely accepted** and is now **completely abandoned**.

## **3. German-Austrian School of Diffusionism**

### **Inspired by**:

* **Fredrick Ratzel**

### **Key Figures**:

* **Fritz Graebner**
* **Father Wilhelm Schmidt**

### **Main Claims**:

* People **borrow from other cultures** due to inherent **lack of inventiveness**.

* Cultural traits could diffuse:
  * **Singly or in groups**
  * Over **great distances**

* Introduced the concept of:
  * **Kulturkreise** (*cultural circles or complexes*)
  * Unlike the British model, which proposed a **single origin (Egypt)**, the German-Austrian school proposed:

    > "Several different cultural complexes."

### **Limitations**:

* Like the British school, the **Kulturkreis approach** provided:

  > “Little documentation for the historical relationships it assumed.”

## **4. American School of Diffusionism**

### **Key Figures**:

* **Clark Wissler**
* **Alfred Kroeber**

### **Approach**:

* Similar method to the **German-Austrian school**, but:
  * **More modest** in theoretical claims.

### **Key Concepts**:

* Traits originate in a **geographical culture center**, then **diffuse outward**.
* **Clark Wissler’s Age-Area Principle**:
  > “If a given trait diffuses outward from a single culture center,
  > it follows that the most widely distributed traits found to exist around such a center must be the oldest traits.”

## **5. Modern View and Criticism**

* Most anthropologists today:
  * **Acknowledge trait diffusion**, but
  * **Reject** the idea that **most cultural development and variation** can be explained solely through diffusion.

### **Main Criticisms**:

* **Superficial treatment** of how traits are **transferred**:

  > "Why a culture accepts, rejects, or modifies a trait that one of its neighbors has" was not adequately addressed.
* Even with a successful tracing of **trait diffusion**, diffusionism failed to explain:

  > “How or why the trait developed within that center in the first place.”

## **6. Franz Boas and the Shift Away from Evolutionism**

* **Early 20th century**: Marked the **decline of evolutionism** in cultural anthropology.
* Leading opponent: **Franz Boas (1858–1942)**

### **Boas’ Main Argument**:

* Rejected the assumption that **universal laws** govern all human cultures.
* Criticized **19th-century evolutionists** for lacking **sufficient data** to form generalizations:

  > Boas himself acknowledged similar limitations in his own era.

### **Legacy**:

* Boas trained the **first generation of American anthropologists**, including:
  * **Alfred Kroeber**
  * **Robert Lowie**
  * **Edward Sapir**
  * **Melville Herskovits**
  * **Margaret Mead**

---

# **Historical Particularism**

## **1. Foundational Beliefs of Franz Boas**

* Boas emphasized the **complexity of cultural variation**.
* He believed this complexity made it **premature** to attempt formulating **universal laws**.
* According to Boas, each **cultural trait** must be studied within the **specific context** of the society where it appears.

## **2. Critique of Evolutionism**

* In **1896**, Boas published:
  * *“The Limitation of the Comparative Method of Anthropology”*
  * This article detailed his **objections to the evolutionist approach**.

### **Main Argument**:

> “Anthropologists should spend less time developing theories based on insufficient data.
> Rather, they should devote their energies to collecting as much data as possible,
> as quickly as possible, before cultures disappeared.”

* He noted that many cultures had **already vanished** due to contact with **foreign societies**.

## **3. Data-First Approach**

* Boas advocated that only **after collecting a vast body of data**, should anthropologists attempt to make **valid interpretations** and **propose theories**.

### **Scientific Method as Boas Saw It**:

> “The essence of science is to mistrust all expectations and to rely only on facts.”

* He believed that with enough information:

  > “The laws governing cultural variation would emerge from the mass of information by themselves.”

## **4. Limitations and Criticisms**

* Despite his emphasis on empiricism, Boas's approach had **limitations**:
  * The **“facts” recorded** by researchers inevitably **reflect personal biases** about what is deemed important.
  * **Data collection without preliminary theorizing** is problematic:

    > “Collecting done without some preliminary theorizing, without ideas about what to expect, is meaningless,
    > for the facts that are most important may be ignored while irrelevant ones may be recorded.”

* While Boas’s criticism of **“armchair theorizing”** was valid, his focus on **local details**:

  * Did **not encourage the belief** that it was possible to explain **major variations** in culture.

---

# **Psychological Approaches in Anthropology**

## **1. Origins and Influences**

* Emerged in the **1920s** among American anthropologists.
* Aimed to study the **relationship between culture and personality**.
* Influenced by:
  * **Sigmund Freud** and other **psychoanalysts**.
  * Early proponents:
    * **Edward Sapir** (student of Boas), who reviewed psychoanalytical literature.
    * **Ruth Benedict** and **Margaret Mead**, also Boas’s students.

## **2. Ruth Benedict's Contribution**

* In *Patterns of Culture*, Benedict argued:
  * **Cultures are patterned**.
  * Different cultures could be **characterized by different personality types**.

## **3. Margaret Mead's Contribution**

* Did **not** focus on **modal personality types** like Benedict.
* Conducted studies in **three societies in New Guinea**:
  * Found **different patterns of sex differences** in personality across societies.
  * Men and women had **different psychological traits** in each society.

* Key conclusion:
  > If women in one society could behave like men in another,
  > then **culture—not biology—was mainly responsible** for personality differences between sexes.

* Although many of their assertions were later **challenged**, their work:
  * **Generated broad interest** in personality studies.
  * Increased public attention toward **anthropology**.

## **4. Kardiner and Linton’s Framework**

* Developed in the **1930s and 1940s** at **Columbia University**.
* Collaborators:
  * **Ralph Linton** (anthropologist)
  * **Abram Kardiner** (psychoanalyst)

### **Kardiner’s Theory:**

* Every culture produces a **basic personality** through **shared cultural experiences**.
* These experiences stem from **primary institutions**, including:
  * Customary economic practices.
  * Family structure.
  * Childrearing customs.

> “Just as a child’s later personality may be shaped by early experiences,
> adult personalities in a society are shaped by common cultural experiences.”

* These result in **secondary institutions**, such as:
  * Ritual
  * Religion
  * Folklore

> These are called “secondary” because they derive from the basic personality structure
> and are meant to **satisfy or reconcile its needs and conflicts**.

## **5. Broader Applications of Kardiner’s Ideas**

* Not all psychological anthropologists adopted **Kardiner’s entire framework**, but:
  * Most agreed on the existence of a **typical personality** in a society.
  * Terms used include:
    * “**Basic personality**”
    * “**National character**”
    * “**Modal personality**”
  * Most accepted that these traits arise from **cultural experience**, especially **childrearing customs**.

## **6. National Character Studies During WWII**

* **Culture-and-personality orientation** extended to **complex societies**.

### **Examples:**

* **Japanese compulsiveness**:
  * Linked to **strict toilet training** in childhood.
* **Russian emotional swings**:
  * Attributed by **Geoffrey Gorer and John Rickman** to:
    * **Swaddling** infants in Soviet nurseries.
    > “Swaddling involves wrapping cloth strips around an infant’s body
    > to keep arms and legs immobile.”

### **Limitations:**

* Wartime conditions prevented **direct fieldwork**.
* Research was based on **indirect methods**.
* Later findings revealed inaccuracies:
  * Japanese toilet training was **not particularly strict**.
  * Early “national character” studies were **crude and unreliable**.

## **7. Evolving Focus of the Psychological Approach**

### **New Areas of Interest:**

* Continued interest in:
  * **Freudian theory**
  * Relationship between **child training and adult personality**

* New investigations into:
  * **Determinants of childrearing variation**

### **Study by Barry, Child, and Bacon:**

* Found that **subsistence strategy** influences childrearing practices:
  * **Agricultural/herding societies**:
    * Stress **routine**, **obedience**, and **responsibility**.
    * Mistakes can **jeopardize a year’s food supply**.
  * **Hunting/fishing societies**:
    * Stress **independence** and **self-reliance**.
    * Mistakes affect only the **daily food supply**.

## **8. Personality as a Mediator of Cultural Traits**

* Expanded on **Kardiner’s idea** that personality links different cultural patterns.

### **Example: Study by Whiting and Child**

* Cultural trait:
  * **Severe punishment for aggression in childhood**
* Psychological consequence:
  * **Exaggerated preoccupation with aggression** in adulthood
* Cultural result:
  * Belief that **aggression causes illness**

## **9. Generalization of the Psychological Approach**

> “The psychological approach to cultural anthropology tries to understand
> how psychological factors and processes may help to explain cultural practices.”

---

# **Functionalism in Anthropology**

## **1. Historical Context and Theoretical Divide**

* In **Europe**, the reaction to **evolutionism** was less dramatic than in the **United States**.
* By the **1930s**, two major anthropological camps emerged:
  * **Diffusionists**
  * **Functionalists**

> **Functionalism** in social science looks for the part (*function*) that some aspect of culture or social life plays in maintaining a **cultural system**.

* Two distinct schools of functionalism arose, each associated with a leading British anthropologist:
  * **Bronislaw Malinowski** (1884–1942)
  * **Arthur Reginald Radcliffe-Brown** (1881–1955)

## **2. Malinowski’s Functionalism: Needs of the Individual**

### **Core Assumptions**

* All **cultural traits** serve the **needs of individuals** in a society.
* The **function** of a cultural trait lies in its ability to **satisfy a basic or derived need**.

### **Basic Needs Identified by Malinowski**

* **Nutrition**
* **Reproduction**
* **Bodily comfort**
* **Safety**
* **Relaxation**
* **Movement**
* **Growth**

### **Derived Needs**

* Arise as a consequence of satisfying basic needs.
* Example:
  > Cultural traits that satisfy the **need for food** lead to a derived need for **cooperation** in food collection or production.
  > This in turn leads to the development of **political organization** and **social control** to ensure cooperation.

### **Explanation of Religion and Magic**

* Humans live with **uncertainty** and **anxiety**.
* Therefore, they need **stability and continuity**.

> “**Religion and magic are functional** in that they serve those needs.”

## **3. Radcliffe-Brown’s Structural-Functionalism: Maintenance of Social Structure**

### **Core Assumptions**

* Cultural traits maintain the **social structure**, rather than satisfying individual needs.
* Defined **social structure** as:
  > “The total network of existing social relationships in a society.”

* This version of functionalism focuses on how **social behavior** sustains the **social system**.

### **Example: Managing Tension Between In-Laws**

Radcliffe-Brown analyzed how societies reduce potential in-law tensions by adopting one of two strategies:

1. **Avoidance Behavior**
   * Example: **Navajos**
   * Men are required to **avoid their mothers-in-law**.

2. **Respectful Teasing**
   * In-laws of the **same generation** may engage in **teasing**.
   * Seen as a way to **avoid real conflict** and help **maintain the social structure**.

> “American mother-in-law jokes may also help relieve tension.”

## **4. Critiques of Functionalism**

### **Malinowski’s Functionalism**

* **Major Objection**:
  * Fails to explain **cultural variation**.
  * While needs like **food** are universal, the ways societies meet them **differ** widely.

> “Functionalism does not explain certain cultural patterns that arise to fulfill a need
> that might be fulfilled just as easily by any of a number of alternative possibilities.”

### **Radcliffe-Brown’s Structural-Functionalism**

* **Primary Criticism**:
  * Difficult to verify if a cultural trait **actually contributes** to maintaining the social system.

> “In biology, the contribution an organ makes to the health or life of an animal can be assessed by removing it.
> But we cannot subtract a cultural trait from a society to see if the trait really does contribute to the maintenance of the group.”

* Some customs may be:
  * **Neutral**
  * **Detrimental**

> “We cannot assume that all of a society’s customs are functional merely because the society is functioning at the moment.”

* Even if functionality is determined, the theory:
  * **Fails to explain** why **one specific solution** was chosen over **alternative possibilities**.

---

# **Neoevolution**

## **1. Revival of Evolutionary Thinking**

* In the **1940s**, **Leslie A. White** (1900–1975) challenged the **Boasian** focus on *historical particularism*.
* White **championed an evolutionist orientation**, becoming associated with what was later called **neoevolutionism**.

> Though quickly labeled a *neoevolutionist*, **White rejected the term**, insisting his approach was consistent with **19th-century evolutionist theories**.

## **2. White’s Theory of Cultural Evolution**

### **Culture as an Energy-Capturing System**

* **White’s “basic law” of cultural evolution**:
  > “*Other factors remaining constant, culture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year is increased or as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting the energy to work is increased.*”
* Key Ideas:
  * **Advanced technology** enables humans to **control more energy** (human, animal, solar, etc.).
  * As energy control increases, **cultures expand and change**.

## **3. Criticisms of White’s Approach**
* **White’s theory** has been criticized similarly to **Tylor** and **Morgan’s** ideas.
* It assumes:
  * Cultural evolution is **internally determined**, primarily by **technological conditions**.
  * No significant role for **environmental**, **historical**, or **psychological** influences.

> This raises the key problem:
> “*Why do some cultures evolve while others either do not evolve or become extinct?*”
* **White’s energy-based model** sidesteps this crucial question.

## **4. Julian H. Steward’s Multilinear Evolution**

* **Julian H. Steward** (1902–1972) proposed a division of evolutionary thought into three categories:
  1. **Unilineal Evolution**
     * Represented by **Morgan** and **Tylor**
     * Views cultural evolution as a **ladder** of progress.
  2. **Universal Evolution**
     * Represented by **Leslie White**
     * Concerned with **culture as a whole**, not individual societies.
  3. **Multilinear Evolution**
     * Steward’s own approach
     * Focuses on the **evolution of particular cultures** and on **parallel sequences** of cultural change across regions.

### **Steward’s Critique of White**

* Steward emphasized the importance of **environmental influences** and **specific cultural differences**.
* He criticized White’s:
  * **Vague generalizations**
  * **Neglect of environmental context**

> White responded by arguing that **Steward fell into the trap of historical particularism** by focusing too much on individual cases.

## **5. The Synthesis: Sahlins and Service**

* **Marshall Sahlins** (b. 1930) and **Elman Service** (1915–1996):
  * **Students and colleagues** of both White and Steward.
  * Attempted to **synthesize** their perspectives.

### **Two Types of Evolution**

1. **Specific Evolution**
   * Analogous to **Steward’s multilinear evolution**
   * Refers to the **unique sequence of change** and adaptation in a **particular society** and environment.
2. **General Evolution**
   * Echoes **White’s universal evolution**
   * Refers to **broad societal progress**, where **higher forms** (with **higher energy capture**) emerge and **surpass lower forms**.

### **Limitations of the Synthesis**

> “*Although this synthesis does serve to integrate the two points of view, it does not give us a way of knowing why cultural evolution has occurred.*”

* Unlike early evolutionists, **some later evolutionists** did attempt to identify mechanisms of cultural evolution:
  * Notably, **adaptation to the environment** as a **driving force** behind the evolution of particular cultures.

---

# **Structuralism**

## **1. Overview of Structuralism**

* **Claude Lévi-Strauss** (born 1908) is the leading proponent of **structuralism** in cultural analysis.
* His version of structuralism differs significantly from that of **Radcliffe-Brown**:
  * **Radcliffe-Brown** focused on **how** societal elements **function as a system**.
  * **Lévi-Strauss** focused on **the origins of systems**, proposing that:
    > Culture, as expressed in **art, ritual, and daily life patterns**, is a **surface representation** of the **underlying structure of the human mind**.

## **2. Binary Oppositions and Cultural Structures**

### **Example: Moiety Systems**

* A **moiety system** is where society is divided into **two large intermarrying kin groups**, each called a **moiety** (from the French *moitié*, meaning "half").
* **Lévi-Strauss's interpretation**:
  > Moiety systems reflect the **human mind’s predisposition** to think in terms of **binary oppositions**.
  * You're born into one group.
  * You marry someone from the other group.

### **Criticism of this Explanation**

* Lévi-Strauss assumes a **universal cognitive dualism** to explain a **non-universal cultural feature**.

  > Moiety systems are present in only **a relatively small number of societies**.
  >
  > Therefore, how can a **universal trait** of the human mind explain something that is **not universal**?

## **3. Focus on Classification and Cognition**

* In works like *The Savage Mind* and *The Raw and the Cooked*, **Lévi-Strauss** emphasized:
  * **Cognitive processes**—how people **perceive and classify** the world.
  * Even **technologically simple societies** often develop **elaborate classification systems** for:
    * **Plants**
    * **Animals**
  * These are used not only for practical purposes but also due to a **need for intellectual activity**.

## **4. British Structuralism: A Different Focus**

* Structuralism also gained influence in **Britain**, though with a distinct approach.
* Prominent British structuralists:
  * **Edmund Leach**
  * **Rodney Needham**
  * **Mary Douglas**

### **Differences from Lévi-Strauss**

* British structuralists:
  * Do **not** seek **panhuman or universal principles**.
  * Focus on **applying structural analysis** to **specific societies** and **institutions**.

### **Example: Mary Douglas on Meal Structure**

* In analyzing a **household debate about soup as supper**, Douglas proposed that meals follow structural principles:
  * Contrasts:
    * **Hot and cold**
    * **Bland and spiced**
    * **Liquid and semi-liquid**
  * Required components:
    * **Cereals**
    * **Vegetables**
    * **Animal protein**

> She concludes:
> *If the food served does not follow these principles, it cannot be considered a meal!*

## **5. Criticisms of Structuralist Approaches**

* Structuralism, especially **Lévi-Strauss’s work**, has faced criticism for:
  * **Overemphasis on theoretical abstraction**.
  * **Lack of observation and empirical evidence**.
  * **Unclear derivation** of interpretations.
  * Absence of **systematically collected supporting data**.

> Readers are often left to **decide for themselves** whether an interpretation is plausible.

### **Limitations**

* Structuralist studies are sometimes regarded as:
  * **Vague and untestable**
  * **Self-contained intellectual constructs**
  * Having **limited explanatory value**

> Even if **universal patterns** exist, they **cannot explain cultural differences**.

---

# **Ethnoscience**

## **1. Definition and Aim**

* **Ethnoscience** is an ethnographic approach that:
  * Seeks to derive **cultural rules** from **logical analysis** of ethnographic data.
  * Attempts to keep this data as **uncontaminated as possible** by the **observer’s own cultural biases**.

## **2. Connection to Structuralism**

* Ethnoscience shares some similarities with **Claude Lévi-Strauss’s structuralism**, particularly in being:
  * Influenced by **descriptive linguistics**.
* However, the similarity **ends there**:
  * **Lévi-Strauss** relies on **intuitive grasping** of thought structures.
  * **Ethnoscience**, by contrast, focuses on **systematic and logical derivation** of rules from ethnographic data.

## **3. Methodology and Approach**

* Ethno-scientists avoid using **predetermined anthropological categories**.
* Instead, they aim to understand a culture from **the insider's point of view** by:
  * Studying the **language**.
  * Analyzing the **specific words** people use to describe their activities.

> Ethno-scientists try to formulate the **rules** that generate **acceptable behavior** in the culture.

* These rules are seen as **analogous to grammatical rules**:
  * Just as grammar governs **language use**, cultural rules govern **behavior**.

## **4. Goals of Ethnoscience**

* Many ethno-scientists believe that:

  > If we can discover the **rules that generate correct cultural behavior**, we can explain much of **what people do and why they do it**.
* These rules may be:
  * **Conscious** or **unconscious**.
  * **Internalized** by individuals within the society.

## **5. Limitation of the Approach**

* Discovering cultural rules **does not explain** why a society developed **those specific rules**.

> Just as a grammar does not explain **how a language came to be what it is**,
> the ethno-scientific discovery of a culture’s rules does not explain **why those rules developed**.

---

# **Cultural Ecology**

## **1. Overview and Key Proponent**

* **Julian Steward** was one of the first anthropologists to advocate for the study of **cultural ecology**.
* **Cultural ecology** refers to:
  > *"The analysis of the relationship between a culture and its environment."*
* Steward believed:
  * Cultural variation could be explained through **societal adaptations** to specific environments.
  * These explanations should be evaluated **empirically**, rather than assumed.

## **2. Distinction from Biological Ecology**
* Steward insisted that **cultural ecology** should be **separated** from **biological ecology**, which studies relationships between organisms and their environment.

## **3. Later Developments in Cultural Ecology**

* Anthropologists such as **Andrew Vayda** and **Roy Rappaport** sought to:
  * Integrate **biological ecology** into **cultural ecology**.
  * Form a **unified science of ecology**.
* Their perspective included the idea that:
  * **Cultural traits**, like biological traits, may be **adaptive** or **maladaptive**.
  * Cultural adaptation operates via **natural selection**:
    > *"Individuals or populations behaving in certain different ways have different degrees of success in survival and reproduction and, consequently, in the transmission of their ways of behaving from generation to generation."*

## **4. Case Study: The Tsembaga of New Guinea**

### **Subsistence Practices**

* The **Tsembaga** are horticulturists in the interior of New Guinea.
  * Depend primarily on **root crops and greens**.
  * Also **raise pigs**, though they are **seldom eaten**.

### **Roles of Pigs**

* Pigs have **multiple functional roles**:
  * Act as **janitors** by consuming garbage.
  * Help **prepare soil** by rooting in it.
  * Require **minimal maintenance**:
    * Roam freely by day.
    * Feed on **substandard tubers** left over from daily harvesting.

### **Problems of Pig Overpopulation**

* As pig herds increase:
  * Substandard tubers are insufficient.
  * Pigs begin to consume **human rations**.
  * Larger herds become **destructive**:
    * **Intrude** on gardens.
    * **Trigger conflicts** between community members:
      * A pig damaging a garden may be killed.
      * Retaliation may escalate to **interpersonal violence** or more pig killings.

### **Ritual Adaptations**

* **Rappaport** proposed:
  * The Tsembaga developed **ritual cycles** involving the **slaughter of surplus pigs**.
  * This served as a **possible adaptation** to the problem of pig overpopulation.

> However, it is unclear whether ritual pig feasts are **more adaptive** than other potential solutions.

* For instance:
  * Regular slaughter and consumption of pigs might **prevent herd overgrowth**.
  * **Cultural ecologists** may struggle to evaluate adaptiveness **without comparing** multiple possible solutions.

## **5. Criticisms from Recent Ecological Anthropologists**

* More recent scholars have criticized earlier ecological models for:
  * **Overemphasizing** isolated local environments.
  * Ignoring **larger contexts**—national and international forces.

> *"There are hardly any people on earth who are not affected in important ways by larger political, social, and environmental forces."*

---

# **Political Economy**

## **1. Core Assumptions**

* Like **cultural ecology**, the school of thought known as **political economy** also assumes that:
  > *"External forces explain the way a society changes and adapts."*

* However, political economy differs by emphasizing:
  * Not just the **natural** or **general social environment**,
  * But specifically the **political impact** of **powerful state societies** (e.g., **Spain**, **Portugal**, **Britain**, and **France**).

* These powers transformed the world through:
  * **Colonialism** and **imperialism** (post–mid-1400s),
  * The emergence of a **world system**.

> *"Scholars now realize that imperialism is at least 5,000 years old; not even all of the first civilizations were imperialistic."*

* The rise of the **first state societies** involved:
  * **Capitalist expansion**,
  * Growth of **commercialization** (buying and selling),
  * And now, the **entire world is linked commercially**.

## **2. Early Political Economy Anthropologists**

### **Columbia University Roots**

* Many of the early political economy theorists were trained at **Columbia University**, where **Julian Steward** taught.
* These students felt that **cultural ecology** lacked attention to:
  * **Recent world history**, especially **colonial** and **economic influences**.

### **Key Figures and Their Contributions**

* **Eric Wolf** and **Sidney Mintz**:
  * Studied communities in **Puerto Rico**.
  * Argued that development was shaped by:
    * **Colonialism** and the rise of **plantations**,
    * Production of **sugar and coffee** for **Europe and North America**.
* **Eleanor Leacock**:
  * Studied the **Montagnais-Naskapi Indians** of **Labrador**.
  * Proposed that:
    > *"Their system of family hunting territories was not an old characteristic, present before European contact, but developed instead out of the Indians’ early involvement in the European-introduced fur trade."*

## **3. Foundational Theorists: Frank and Wallerstein**

### **André Gunder Frank**

* Emphasized:
  * Development of one region (e.g., **Europe**) was dependent on:
    * The **suppression** or **underdevelopment** of others (e.g., **New World**, **Africa**).
* Key idea:
  > *"If we want to understand why a country remains underdeveloped, we must understand how it is exploited by nations."*
* Focused on:
  * **Underdevelopment** in colonized regions.

### **Immanuel Wallerstein**

* Concerned with:
  * How **capitalism** developed in **privileged countries**.
  * How the **expansionist nature** of capitalism led to:
    * The rise of a **world system**.

## **4. Influence on Anthropology**

* The **political economy** or **world-system view** led anthropologists to:
  * Engage more deeply with **history**.
  * Study the effects of **external political and economic forces** on:
    * Local cultures and **events** in the **underdeveloped world**.

### **Challenging the Notion of Isolation**

* Early anthropologists once believed they were studying:
  * Cultures **isolated** from external influences.
* The political economy approach highlighted that:
  > *"In the modern world, such isolation hardly exists."*
* Conclusion:
  > *"The political economy approach has reminded us that the world, every part of it, is interconnected, for better or worse."*

# **Sociobiology, Behavioral Ecology, and Evolutionary Biology/Psychology**

## **1. Introduction and Core Concepts**

* These perspectives relate closely to **cultural ecology** but extend the idea that:

  > *"Natural selection can operate on the behavioral or social characteristics of populations (and not just on their physical traits)."*

* **Behavioral ecology** (earlier called **sociobiology**, now often known as **evolutionary biology** or **evolutionary psychology**) was:

  * Developed mainly by **biologists**.
  * Applies **biological evolutionary principles** to the **social behavior** of animals, including humans.
  * Has been used by some **cultural anthropologists** to explain aspects of **cultural variability**.

## **2. Comparison: Behavioral Ecology vs. Cultural Ecology**

| Feature                     | **Cultural Ecology**                                                    | **Behavioral Ecology**                                        |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Focus of Selection**      | *Group selection*                                                       | *Individual selection*                                        |
| **Adaptation Explained By** | Benefits to the **group or society** in an environment                  | Benefits to the **individual** in an environment              |
| **Transmission Mechanism**  | *Cultural transmission* (social/behavioral traits passed on culturally) | *Genetic or learned transmission* (benefits kin or offspring) |
| **Definition of Adaptive**  | Trait passed on due to benefit to group/society                         | Trait helps individual get genes into future generations      |

* Example:
  * A **cultural ecologist** (e.g., **Rappaport**) might study:
    > *"How ritual pig feasts were adaptive for the Tsembaga as a whole."*
  * A **behavioral ecologist** would ask:
    * Do individuals who organize pig feasts have **more children**?
    * Do they **destroy rivals' gardens**, giving them a **reproductive advantage**?
    * Does cutting down pig populations improve **individual survival chances**?

## **3. The Behavioral Ecology Perspective on Social Behavior**

* **Key Assumption**:
  > *"Behavioral ecological theory does not expect that 'social good' will prevail unless 'individual good' underlies it."*
* Example: **Environmental conservation**
  * Long-term societal benefits (e.g., conserving Earth’s resources) are **not expected** to influence behavior unless:
    > *"An individual or family saw short-term negative effects of their not conserving."*
  * **Bobbi Low**'s cross-cultural findings:
    > *"Conservation ideas (reasons to leave resources untouched) are very rare, occurring in only 5 percent of the societies surveyed."*

## **4. Explaining Altruism**

* **Behavioral ecology** can explain some **apparent altruistic behaviors** if they result in **genetic or future return benefits**:
  * Adopting or caring for a **relative’s child** may help perpetuate one’s **own genes**.
  * **Sharing food** today may lead to increased **future food intake**.
* **Limitations**:
  * Hard to explain behaviors with **no apparent gain** to the altruist.
    * Example questions:

      > *"Why do so many people in the United States and other countries believe in the value of conservation?"*
      > *"Why did some people in Nazi Germany, at risk to their own safety, hide people from the Nazis?"*

# **Feminist Approaches in Anthropology**

## **1. Historical Context and Emergence**

* Despite notable women contributors like **Margaret Mead**, **Ruth Benedict**, and **Mary Douglas**, the study of women in anthropology remained **rare** until the 1960s.
* At that time, women anthropologists began to ask:
  > *"Why were women not a more important focus of research?"*
* Two key scholarly perspectives emerged:
  * **Perspective 1**: Women were in **subservient positions** in all cultures, making them largely *“invisible”* to anthropologists.
  * **Perspective 2**: Women had historically held **power and authority** in many cultures, but **colonization and capitalism** diminished their roles.
* These critiques led to the **birth of feminist anthropology**, emphasizing the need for focused studies on **women's roles** in various societies.

## **2. Diversity in Feminist Anthropology**

* Feminist anthropology is a **highly diverse** field unified by a common interest: the **role of women in culture**.
* Approaches vary widely:
  * **Political feminist anthropologists**:
    > *See their task as identifying ways in which women are exploited and working to overcome them.*
  * **Descriptive feminist anthropologists**:
    > *Aim simply to understand women’s lives and how they differ from those of men.*

### **Notable Contributions**

* **Annette Weiner**:
  * Revisited **Malinowski’s** research on the **Trobriand Islands**.
  * Discovered a previously **overlooked women-run economic system**.
* **Sally Slocum**:
  * Critiqued the **paleoanthropological** focus on hunting (a male-associated activity).
  * Highlighted the neglect of **gathering**, a typically **female** activity, despite its greater nutritional importance in some **foraging societies**.
  * Her work prompted:

    > *"Paleoanthropologists to consider the role of women in human evolution."*

## **3. Impact on Fieldwork and Methodology**

* Feminist research underscores that an anthropologist’s **own culture** shapes their **perception** of other cultures.

### **Fieldwork Limitations Based on Gender**

* **Male researchers**:
  > *May not be able to ask about or observe some women’s roles.*

* **Female researchers**:
  > *May not be able to ask about or observe some men’s roles.*

### **Challenging Scientific Objectivity**

* Feminist scholarship proposes that:
  > *“The scientific approach is only one way of studying other cultures,”*
  > and suggests that **alternative approaches** may yield **different understandings**.

## **4. Two Theoretical Agendas from Feminist Anthropology**

### **Agenda 1: Critique of Science**

* Argues that **science is inherently male** in orientation and has:

  > *“Furthered the subjugation of women.”*
* However, **female scientists** in opposition argue:
  > *“Science is neither male nor female.”*

### **Agenda 2: Alternative Ethnographic Methods**

* Seeks to:
  * **Give more voice** to the people being studied.
  * Allow for the **feelings, opinions, and insights** of the observer to be **openly expressed**.
* Methods include:
  * **Personal narratives**
  * **Storytelling**
  * **Poetry**

> *These creative forms are used to express anthropologists’ understandings of the cultures they have studied.*

---

# **Interpretive Approaches in Anthropology**

## **1. Origins and Influences**

* The rise of **interpretive anthropology** was influenced by:
  * The **“literary turn”** in anthropology.
  * **Feminist anthropology**, but not exclusively.
  * Developments in **literary criticism** since the 1960s.
* Anthropologists began to incorporate:
  * **Fiction**
  * **Personal insights**
  * **Poetry**

  as valid forms of **ethnography**.

## **2. Culture as a Text: Clifford Geertz’s Perspective**

* **Clifford Geertz** (b. 1926) advanced a central idea:
  > *“A culture is like a literary text that can be analyzed for meaning, as the ethnographer interprets it.”*
* According to Geertz:
  * Ethnographers select aspects of culture that interest them.
  * They act as **selective intercultural translators**, conveying meaning to their own cultural audience.

## **3. Goals of Interpretive Anthropology**

* Focus is not on explaining *why* cultures vary, but on understanding:
  > *“What it means to be a person living in a particular culture.”*
* Scientific methods are considered **insufficient** to grasp cultural meaning.
* Instead, interpretive anthropologists employ:
  * **Literary analysis**
  * Especially **hermeneutics** – the study of meaning
* Example:
  **Geertz’s analysis of cockfights** in Bali
  > *“Reflects, and thus allows us to comprehend, the Balinese worldview.”*

## **4. Subjectivity in Interpretation**

* Interpretive analysis is **openly subjective and personal**.
  > *“Geertz’s interpretation of the Balinese cockfight is neither right nor wrong—it is simply his.”*
* A different anthropologist may reach an entirely different conclusion.
* This reflects the view that:
  > *“No human sees the world in quite the same way.”*
* Anthropology, therefore, becomes as much a **reflection of the anthropologist** as it is a description of others.
* **Critiques**:
  * Many find this **self-centered** approach unappealing.
  * Others see it as the **only truthful** approach to anthropology.

## **5. Debate: Interpretation vs. Scientific Explanation**

* Some interpretive anthropologists argue:
  > *“Interpretation is the only achievable goal in cultural anthropology.”*
* Their reasoning:
  * **Cultural phenomena cannot be described or measured objectively**.
  * **Scientific objectivity** is unattainable.
* **Scientific anthropologists**, however, disagree:
  * They acknowledge that interpretive ethnographies may provide **insight**.
  * But they stress the need for **objective evidence**.
  * Scientific research employs methods to:
    * **Minimize bias**
    * **Increase objectivity**

## **6. Interpretation vs. Explanation: Dan Sperber’s Distinction**

* **Dan Sperber** distinguishes two types of understanding:

  | **Interpretation**                                     | **Explanation**                                  |
  | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
  | Conveys **intuitive understanding**                    | Provides **general and causal understanding**    |
  | Uses literary or narrative forms                       | Uses systematic scientific methods               |
  | Goal: what an experience *feels like*                  | Goal: why a phenomenon *occurs*                  |
  | Ethnographer is like a **novelist or literary critic** | Researcher is like a **scientific investigator** |

## **7. Conclusion: Complementary Perspectives**

* The goals of **interpretation** and **explanation** are not mutually exclusive.
> *“We share Sperber’s view that interpretation and explanation are not opposed, but convey very different kinds of understanding.”*
* An interpretation may lead to a **testable hypothesis**:

  > *“An intuitive interpretation described in causal and general terms might turn out, when scientifically tested, to be a powerful explanation!”*

# **Postmodern Approaches in Anthropology**

## **1. Foundations and Core Assumptions**

* **Feminist** and **interpretive approaches** suggest:
  > *“All knowledge is subjective.”*
* **Postmodern scholars** extend this by arguing:
  > *“All knowledge is not only subjective but also active—shaped by the political powers-that-be.”*
## **2. Influence of Michel Foucault**
* One of the most influential postmodern theorists:
  * **Michel Foucault** (1926–1984), French philosopher.
* Foucault's core argument:
  > *“Those in political power are able to shape the way truth is defined through science.”*
  > *“Science is controlled by Western political and intellectual elites.”*
  > *“Science is not only a way of understanding the world, it is a way of controlling and dominating it.”*

## **3. Anthropology as a Tool of Power**

* According to the **postmodern view of science**:
  * **Anthropology** is seen as:

    > *“Just another tool used by dominant powers to control others.”*
* The concern:
  * Studying people **“objectively”** may:

    > *“Dehumanize the people being studied.”*
    > *“Turn people into objects for study,”*
    > thus allowing them to be *“molded and used by political powers-that-be.”*

## **4. The Postmodern Critique and Challenge**

* Fundamental question:

  > *“How can anthropology continue to exist if its efforts contribute to the domination and control of others?”*
* This challenges the discipline’s **commitment to cultural relativism**.

## **5. Postmodern Response: Activism and Advocacy**

* **Postmodern scholars** propose a transformation:
  * Anthropology must become a **purely activist discipline**.
  * Its mission should be:
    > *“To express the voices of the dominated rather than to study or interpret them.”*
    > *“A conduit for the disenfranchised and subjugated to be heard.”*
* Open question:

  > *“Does that preclude anthropology from being scientific?”*

## **6. The Ongoing Relevance of Anthropology**

* Despite challenges from **postmodern**, **interpretive**, and **some feminist** perspectives:
  * Anthropology as a discipline **continues to thrive**.
* Reasons for its resilience:
  * Lessons learned from critical scholarship:
    * **No anthropologist today can ignore women’s roles**.
    * It is no longer acceptable to neglect **half of humanity**.
  * Dual focus in contemporary anthropology:
    * **Understanding meaning**
    * **Explaining variation**
* Acknowledgment of subjectivity:

  > *“Anthropologists realize that their knowledge of others is possibly subjective and imperfect.”*
* Yet this does **not** mean:
  > *“It is impossible to study humans and their cultures scientifically.”*

# **The Hypothesis-Testing Orientation**

## **1. Origins of the Scientific Method**

* **Context**: Developed in the **mid-17th century** by early scientists.
* **Motivation**: Acknowledgement that human knowledge can be:
  * **Biased**
  * **Incomplete**
* **Scientific response**: Rather than **rejecting** the possibility of **objective understanding**, science developed a **rigorous method** for testing ideas.

> **Philip Salzman** explains:
>
> *"The scientific method, the heart of science, was invented because it was understood that human error, wish-fulfillment, duplicity, dishonesty, and weakness would commonly distort research findings. The scientific requirements that the procedures of all studies must be specified in detail so that others could repeat them, and the actual replication of findings by other scientists in other venues, were established to minimize the distorting effects of human subjectivity and moral weakness in the quest for knowledge."*

## **2. Science and Anthropology: Points of Tension**

* **Many anthropologists** continue to support the idea that:
  * **Objective knowledge is possible** through scientific methods.
* However, interpretive anthropologists argue that:
  * If anthropology's goal is to understand **what it means to be human** in various cultural contexts,
  * Then **science may not be the appropriate method** for every inquiry.
* Summary:

  > *“The task of explanation is just different from the task of interpretation.”*

## **3. The Rise of the Hypothesis-Testing Orientation**

* **Contemporary trend**:
  * Increasing number of cultural anthropologists reject strict allegiance to:
    * **Any single theoretical orientation**
    * **Fixed subject interests**
    * **Specific research methods**
* Instead, they adopt a **hypothesis-testing orientation**:
  * **Open to all types of theory**
  * **Flexible with methods**
  * **Guided by research questions**

## **4. Principles of the Hypothesis-Testing Approach**

* Core belief:
  > *“Any explanation should be exposed to the possibility of being falsified by some set of systematically collected data.”*
* Implication:
  * Without testing:

    > *“We are entitled or even obliged to be skeptical about the validity of any suggested explanation.”*
