## **Structuralism**: Contributions of Claude Lévi-Strauss (1908–2009)

### Academic Reputation
- **Claude Lévi-Strauss** is widely regarded as the **most distinguished exponent** of his academic field outside the **English-speaking world**.
- Recognized for his **scholarly intellectualism** and consistent academic rigor from the outset of his career.
- His **sociological theories** are characterized by:
  - **Baffling complexity**
  - **Overwhelming erudition**
- Some readers perceive his work as potentially a **confidence trick** due to its complexity, yet his **academic importance** remains **unquestioned**.

### Theoretical Approach: **Structuralism**
- **Lévi-Strauss’s structural approach** is rooted in linguistic theories:
  - Based on the work of **Troubetzkoy** and **Sapir**.
- Focuses on establishing facts about the **human mind** rather than the organization of specific societies or social classes.

### Distinction from **Functionalism**
- Most **social anthropologists** in **Britain** and the **United States** identify as **functionalists**, following the style and tradition of **Malinowski**.
- **Functionalism** emphasizes the organization of particular societies or classes.
- In contrast, **Lévi-Strauss’s** ultimate concern is:
  > "to establish facts which are true about the **human mind**, rather than about the organization of any particular **society** or **class of society**."
- This distinction is described as **fundamental**, highlighting the unique orientation of **Lévi-Strauss’s structuralism**.

## **Structural Linguistics**

### Overview
- **Structural linguistics** is the domain of study focused on the **structural analysis** of **language**.
- Every **language** comprises two key aspects:
  - **Phonological aspect** (or **Phonology**)
  - **Grammatical aspect** (or **Grammar**)

### Components of **Language**
- **Phonology**:
  - The study of **phonemes**, the basic units of **language**, and the **rules** governing their sequences.
  - **Phonemes** are finite, typically ranging between **thirty and forty-five** in number.
- **Grammar**:
  - Involves the identification of **morphemes**, which are recurring sequences of **phonemes** that carry **meaning**.
  - Studies the **rules** governing the sequences in which **morphemes** occur.
  - **Morphemes** are potentially **infinite** in number and form the **lexicon** of a language.
- Every **language** contains:
  - A **finite** set of **phonemes**.
  - A set of **rules** governing how **phonemes** combine.
  - A large number of **morphemes** (free and bound), constituting the **lexicon**.
  - A **finite** number of arrangements governing how **morphemes** are combined to produce **intelligible utterances**.
- The **structure of a language** integrates these elements, allowing any **utterance** to be described in terms of these components.

### Analytical Process
- The next step in **structural linguistics** is to **analyze** and discover the **logic** of these **language structures**.

### **Noam Chomsky**’s Contribution: **Generative Transformational Grammar**
- **Chomsky** introduced the concepts of **deep structure** and **surface structure** to explain sentence formation:
  > "Any **sentence** in any **language** comprises of a **deep structure** and a **surface structure**. Any **utterance** is built-up swiftly and unconsciously from certain basic **phonemes** that make up the **deep structure**."
- Analytical process:
  - A **linguist** analyzes **phonemes** into **distinctive features**.
  - These features are grouped into one or several **pairs of opposition**.
  - The **complete sentence** (the **surface structure**) is a complex web of **transformed** and **integrated units** derived from the **deep structure**.
- Variations across **languages**:
  - While the principle of **deep structure** to **surface structure** transformation is universal, the specific **deep structure** and **transformation processes** vary based on **conventions**, **habits**, and **cultural adaptations** of different societies.
- This theory is known as **Generative Transformational Grammar**.

### **N. Troubetzkoy**’s Four Operations of **Structural Linguistics**
- **Troubetzkoy** outlines four key operations that define **structural linguistics**:
  1. Studying the **unconscious linguistic structure**.
  2. Treating **terms** not as isolated but as a **set of relations**.
  3. Introducing the concept of **system**, demonstrating concrete **phonemic systems** and elucidating their **structure**.
  4. Aiming to discover **laws** governing linguistic structures.

## **Structural Linguistics**: Claude Lévi-Strauss’s Views

### **Linguistics** as a **Social Science**
- **Claude Lévi-Strauss** considers **linguistics** a **social science**, uniquely distinguished as the only one to have attained the status of a **full science** among **social studies**.
- He emphasizes the need for **social anthropologists** to integrate **structural linguistics** into their study of **kinship organization**:
  > "Ever since the distinction between **kinship terminology** and **kinship structures** cleared, **social anthropologists** interested in the study of **kinship organization** have been unable to pay considerable attention towards the **structural aspects** of **language**."
- **Lévi-Strauss** argues that understanding **kinship structure** requires studying the **structure of language**.
- Similarly, in **historical** and **social-linguistics**, **linguists** rely on **anthropological data** to make progress.

### Methods of **Structural Linguistics**
- According to **Lévi-Strauss**, the methods of **structural linguistics** can be reduced to four basic operations:
  1. Shifting focus from **conscious linguistic phenomena** to their **unconscious infrastructure**.
  2. Focusing on the **relations between terms** rather than treating **linguistic terms** as distinct or isolated entities.
  3. Employing the concept of **systems**.
  4. Aiming to discover **general laws**.

### Application to **Kinship Studies**
- **Lévi-Strauss** compares the anthropologist’s approach to **kinship studies** to that of a **structural linguist**:
  > "In the study of **kinship** or other problems as well, the **anthropologist** finds himself in a situation, which formally resembles that of the **structural linguist**."
- **Kinship terms**, like **phonemes**, acquire meaning only when integrated into **systems**:
  > "**Kinship systems** like **phonemes systems** are built by the mind on the level of **unconscious thought**."
- The recurrence of **kinship patterns**, **marriage rules**, and **prescribed attitudes** across diverse societies suggests that both **kinship** and **linguistic phenomena** result from **general but implicit laws**:
  > "The recurrence of **kinship patterns**, **marriage rules**, **prescribed attitudes** between certain types of relations and so forth either in scattered regions of globe or in fundamentally different **societies** lead us to believe that in case of both **kinship** as well as **linguistics** the **observable phenomena** result from the action of **laws**, which are **general** but **implicit**."
- **Kinship phenomena** and **linguistic phenomena** are of the **same type**, despite belonging to different aspects of reality.

### Challenges in Applying **Structural Linguistics** to **Kinship**
- **Lévi-Strauss** notes limitations in applying **structural linguistics** to **kinship**:
  - Analyzing **kinship terms** as phenomena (breaking them into components) results in a system more **abstract** and **complex** than the **empirical data**.
- Distinctive characteristics of **kinship terminology**:
  - **Kinship terms** are **parts of speech** and must be treated directly by **linguistic methods**.
  - **Linguistic structuralism** is not directly applicable at the **vocabulary level** of **kinship terms**.
  - **Kinship terms**, as **vocabulary elements**, are not inherently amenable to **structural treatment**.
  - The **kinship system of terminology** includes a **system of attitudes** (e.g., **respect**, **familiarity**, **rights**, **obligations**, **affection**, or **hostility**).
  - The **system of terminology** and **system of attitudes** are **functionally related** but not necessarily **coterminous**, and in practice, they often differ.
- **Lévi-Strauss** believes applying the formal methods of **structural linguistics** to the **theory of attitudes** could elevate it to a **generalizable** and **analytically valuable** level.

### Analysis of the **Avuncular Relationship**
- **Lévi-Strauss** illustrates his views through the **structural principles** governing the **avuncular relationship**:
  - A **kinship system** functions as a **language** and a **semantic system**, similar to **art** and other **cultural aspects**, which are **symbolic systems** with **semantic functions** (though these may be **fragmentary** or **subjective**).
  - The **structural principles** or **grammars** of such systems are largely **unconscious** but can be elucidated through the **correct method**.
  - All forms of **social life** are substantially of the **same nature**, serving as projections of **universal laws** regulating the **unconscious activities of the mind**:
    > "The **structural principle** or **grammars** of such **systems** are largely **unconscious**, although this does not prevent them from being elucidated by **correct method**. The corollary of this is that we may be able to show that all forms of **social life** are substantially of **same nature**. As the projection on the level of **conscious** and **civilized thought**, they provide illustration of the **universal laws**, which regulate the **unconscious activities** of the **mind**."

### **Incest Taboo** and **Elementary Structures of Kinship**
- In his book, **Elementary Structure of Kinship** (1949), **Lévi-Strauss** discusses the **incest taboo**:
  - The **incest taboo** is empirically present in **every society**, though specific **rules** vary across **societies** and **cultures**.
  - While **incest taboos** have **social functions**, these cannot explain their **origin**, as early humans could not have foreseen their advantages.
  - The **incest taboo** stems from the **human mind**’s tendency to think in **opposites**, particularly the **dichotomy** between **self** and **others**:
    > "The most fundamental **dichotomy** to be recognized for **man** to become **human** and to develop **culture** is that between **self** and **others**. Only when this distinction is made, a true **symbolic communication** is possible."
- **Reciprocal exchange** operates on three fundamental levels:
  1. **Exchange of messages**
  2. **Exchange of goods**
  3. **Exchange of women**
- The **incest taboo** regulates the **exchange of women**, distinguishing human **marriage rules** from random, promiscuous mating among animals:
  > "**Incest taboos** are concerned with **exchange of women**. Among **animals** mating is **random** and **promiscuous** but **incest taboo**, by its very nature, dictates on ordered **exchange of women**, and thus also institutes **marriage rules**."
- This **reciprocity** initiates a cycle of **reciprocal exchanges** on other levels, marking the distinction between **nature** and **culture**:
  > "**Incest taboo** thus, marks the differences between **nature** and **culture**—the most basic **dichotomy** is present in many **cultural systems**, such as **totemism**, **myth**, **art**, **ritual** and the way in which people name their **pets**."

## **Totemism**: Claude Lévi-Strauss’s Views

### Overview of **Totemism** (1962)
- In his book **Totemism** (1962), **Claude Lévi-Strauss** explores the role of **animals** and **objects** as **symbols** for **clans** or **families**.
- These are selected as **linguistic** and **classificatory devices** to order **social relationships** between **groups**.
- **Totemism** expresses the relationship between **nature** and **culture**:
  > "It also expresses the relationship between **nature** and **culture**."

### Critique of Earlier **Totemists**
- **Lévi-Strauss** criticizes earlier **totemists** for two key mistakes:
  1. Assuming a **direct relationship** between the **totem** and **man** based on **contiguity**, whereas **Lévi-Strauss** argues it is always **masked** or **metaphorical**.
  2. Ignoring the **opposition** between **personal** and **collective relations** with the **totem**.
- Earlier **totemists** incorrectly linked **totemic institutions** strictly to **exogamy rules**.

### Clarifying the Concept of **Totemism**
- **Lévi-Strauss** argues that **totemism** is often misunderstood, confusing two distinct problems:
  1. The frequent **identification** of **human beings** with **plants** or **animals**, relating to general views of **man** and **nature**.
  2. The **designation** of **kinship-based groups** using **animal** or **vegetable terms**, though other methods of designation are also possible.
- The term **totemism** applies only when these two orders **coincide**:
  > "The term **totemism** covers only cases in which there is **coincidence** of two orders."

### Key Questions in **Totemism**
- **Lévi-Strauss** identifies two central questions:
  1. Why are **animal** and **vegetable species** selected to provide a **nomenclature** for a **social system**?
  2. What kinds of **relationships** exist between **animal/plant species** and the **social system**?
- Answer: The **environment** alone does not explain their selection. Their use reflects the **mode of thought** of the **human mind**:
  > "The link between **man** and **nature** is not **direct** but passing through **human mind**."

### **Structural Method** for Analyzing **Totemism**
- **Lévi-Strauss** proposes a **structural method** involving three operations:
  1. Define the phenomenon as a **relation** between two or more **terms** (real or supposed).
  2. Construct a **table of possible permutations** between these **terms**.
  3. Use the resulting **table** as the object of **analysis** to identify **necessary connections**, as **empirical phenomena** are **contingent**.
- **Totemism** involves **relations** posed by **ideology** between two series:
  - **Natural series**: Comprising **categories** and **particulars**.
  - **Cultural series**: Comprising **groups** and **persons**.
- These **relations** can be elucidated in four ways:
  | Combination | Nature   | Culture | Example |
  |-------------|----------|---------|---------|
  | 1           | **Category** | **Group** | **Social and sexual totems** of some **Australian tribes** (e.g., relationship between a **natural category** of **animal** and a **cultural group** like **Moiety**, **Section**, **Sub-section**, **cult-group**, or **corpore group** of same-sex members). |
  | 2           | **Category** | **Person** | **Individual totem** of a **North-American Indian**, where an individual identifies with a **natural category** through **physical traits**. |
  | 3           | **Particular** | **Person** | **Totemism in Mota (Banks Islands)**, where a child is believed to be the **incarnation** of an **animal** or **plant** discovered and consumed by the mother during pregnancy awareness. |
  | 4           | **Particular** | **Group** | A **natural species** accorded **protection** by a **social group**, as seen in **Mooris**. |

### Scope of **Totemism**
- **Lévi-Strauss** argues that only the **first two combinations** constitute true **totemism**.
- The **third** and **fourth combinations** are **totemic illusions**, resulting from a **distortion of semantic field** due to a **mistaken division of reality**:
  > "The alleged **totemism** is no more than a particular **expression**, by means of a **social nomenclature** formed of **animal** and **plant names**, which is its sole distinctive characteristics, of **correlations** and **opposition**."
- **Natural species** are chosen not because they are **good to eat** but because they are **good to think**:
  > "In **totemism** **natural species** are chosen not because they are **good to eat** but because they are **good to think**, their **perceptive reality** permits the embodiment of **ideas** and **relations** conceived by **speculative thought** on the basis of **empirical observation**."

### **Lévi-Strauss**’s Perspective
- **Lévi-Strauss** does not **dissolve** the problem of **totemism** but elevates it to the **plane of logic** rather than **fact**.
- He is described as a **mental totamist**, not a **non-totamist**, emphasizing the **logical** and **structural** underpinnings of **totemic systems**.

## **Structural Analysis of Myth**: Claude Lévi-Strauss’s Views

### Characteristics of **Myth**
- **Claude Lévi-Strauss** identifies key characteristics of **myth**:
  - **Linguistic Nature**:
    - **Myth** is inherently **linguistic**, embodying the distinction between **langue** and **parole** (as per **Saussure**’s framework):
      > "**Myth** like **language** is both **langue** (the **structural** & **reversible** aspect) and **parole** (the **statistic** and **non-reversible** aspect)."
  - **Timelessness**:
    - **Myth** is distinguished by its **pattern of events** or **attitudes**, which transcends **time limits** and applies equally to the **past**, **present**, and **future**.
  - **Distinction from Poetry**:
    - **Lévi-Strauss** differentiates **myth** from **poetry**:
      > "**Poetry** is a kind of **speech** which cannot be **translated**, except at the cost of **serious distortion**, whereas the **mythical value** in the **myth** is **preserved**, even through the **worst translation**."
  - **Focus on Story**:
    - The essence of **myth** lies not in its **style**, **original music**, or **syntax**, but in the **story** it tells:
      > "The **substance** of **myth** does not lie in its **style**, its **original music** or its **syntax**, but in the **story** which it tells."

## **Structural Analysis of Myth**: Claude Lévi-Strauss’s Views

### The **Unconscious Mind** and **Myth-Making**
- **Claude Lévi-Strauss**’s search for the nature of the **unconscious mind** led him to study **myth**, as it is the human activity closest to the **unconscious**.
- **Myth-making** is primarily constrained by its own **inherent principles**, not by **social utility**:
  > "The **myth-making mind** is constrained mainly by its own **inherent principles** and not by **social utility**."
- Unlike **kinship systems**, **marriage rules**, or **village organization**, which are influenced by **social life contingencies**, **myth** operates independently of such considerations.

### **Structural Analysis** of **Myth**
- In his article, **‘The Structural Study of Myth’ (1963)**, **Lévi-Strauss** analyzed various versions of the **Oedipus myth**:
  - **Myths** should not be read as **stories** but broken down into **basic units** called **mythemes**.
  - The **relationships** between these **mythemes** must be examined to understand their **structural significance**.
- In his four-volume work, **Mythologiques** (1964, 1966, 1968, 1972), he elaborated this method:
  - In **The Raw & the Cooked** (1969), he explored **187 South American myths**.
  - Subsequent volumes analyzed an additional **600 Indian myths**.
  - Despite differences in **content**, **Lévi-Strauss** demonstrated that their **underlying structures** display **significant similarities**:
    > "Together they are like an **Orchestral Score**, where each instrument sounds something **different**, but what kind of **sound** it makes is part of a **structural whole**."

### Harmonizing Differences in **Myths**
- Differences between **myths** are reconciled by analyzing them in terms of **simple oppositions**, with the **nature–culture dichotomy** being prominent.
- **Mythemes** are **translated**, **transposed**, and **transformed** to reveal their **common grounds**:
  > "Unlike **mythical elements** possess the same **structural significance**."

### Propositions on **Structural Analysis** of **Myth**
- **Lévi-Strauss** summarizes his approach with the following propositions:
  1. The **meaning** of **mythology** lies not in **isolated elements** but in how these elements are **combined**:
     > "If there is a **meaning** to be found in **mythology**, it cannot reside in the **isolated elements**, which enter into the composition of **myth**, but only in the way those **elements** are **combined**."
  2. **Myth** is a part of **language** but has **specific properties** in its **mythic usages**.
  3. These **properties** are **more complex** than those in other forms of **linguistic expression**, existing **above the ordinary linguistic level**.
  4. **Myth** is constituted by **units**, similar to the rest of **language**.
  5. These **units**, called **gross constituent units**, are more complex than **phonemes** and consist of **relations**:
     > "The true **constituent units** of a **myth** are not the **isolated relations** but **bundles of such relations**, and it is as **bundles** that these **relations** can be put to use and **combined** so as to produce a **meaning**."
- **Myths** represent the **nature–culture dichotomy**, often linked to the **incest taboo**.

### Examples of **Structural Analysis**
- **Lévi-Strauss** illustrates how **mythical elements** reflect the **nature–culture dichotomy**:
  - **Honey**:
    - Always consumed **raw**, representing **nature**.
    - Also **enticing** and **seductive**, so **myths** about **seduction** share the same **structural position** as **honey**.
  - **Ashes**, **Fire**, **Tobacco**, and **Wild Pig**:
    - **Ashes** and **fire** signify **culture**, as **fire** is one of **man’s earliest inventions**.
    - **Tobacco** requires **fire** for consumption, and **wild pig’s meat** is never eaten **uncooked**.
    - **Myths** dealing with **tobacco**, the **origin of the wild pig**, **fire**, **ashes**, **cooking**, **smoke**, and **burning** are structurally related.
- Note: These transformations can appear **arbitrary** and **far-fetched**, though **Lévi-Strauss** presents them with **elegance** and **eloquence**.

## **The Raw & the Cooked**: Claude Lévi-Strauss’s Views

### **Structural Analysis** of Meals
- **Claude Lévi-Strauss** argues that **meals** have a **structure**, with **foods** and their **modes of preparation** conveying **coded messages**:
  > "All **cultures** send out **messages** coded in the medium of **foods** and in the **modes of preparation** of the **foods**."
- **Cooked foods** communicate messages about their alignment with **culture** or **nature** through their **structural components**.

### **Endocuisine** vs. **Exocuisine**
- **Lévi-Strauss** distinguishes between **boiled** and **roasted foods**:
  - **Boiled foods** belong to **endocuisine**:
    - Prepared for **domestic use** and destined for a **small closed group** (e.g., **family meal**).
    - Example: In France, **boiled chicken** was traditionally for **family meals**.
  - **Roasted foods** belong to **exocuisine**:
    - Offered to **guests**, often for **banquets**.
    - Example: **Roasted meat** was for **banquets**.
  - Direct quote:
    > "The **boiled** can most often be ascribed to what might be called an **endocuisine**: prepared for **domestic use**, destined to a **small closed group**, while the **roasted** belong to **exocuisine**, that which one offers to **guests**. Formerly in **France**, **boiled chicken** was for the **family meal**, whole **roasted meat** was for **banquet**…"

### The **Nature–Culture Dichotomy**
- **Boiled food** aligns with **culture**:
  - Requires a **container** and a **barrier of water** between the **food** and the **fire**.
- **Roasted food** aligns with **nature**:
  - Involves **direct contact** between the **food** and the **flame**.
- **Lévi-Strauss** formulates this as:
  > "**Roasted : Boiled :: Nature : Culture**"

### Application to **Cannibalism**
- **Lévi-Strauss** used this **formula** to make predictions about **practices of cannibalism**, based on the **nature–culture dichotomy**.

### Critique
- **Paul Shankaman** (1969) disagreed with **Lévi-Strauss**’s **formula** based on his own study, challenging its applicability or accuracy.

## **Edmund Leach and Traffic Signals**

### **Structural Analysis** of **Traffic Signals**
- **Edmund Leach** argues that **traffic signals** reflect a **structural relationship** with the **color spectrum**, illustrating how the **human mind** organizes information:
  > "With **traffic lights** on both **railways** and **roads**, **green** means and **red** means **stop**, if we want to devise further **signal** with an **intermediate meaning**, we choose the **colour yellow**. We do this because, in the **spectrum** it lies **midway** between **green** and **red**…the **colour system** and the **signal system** have the **same structure**: the one is a **transformation** of the other."
- The **mind** **dichotomizes** the **color spectrum**, creating a **binary opposition** from a **continuum**:
  - **Green** and **red** represent the **extremes**.
  - **Yellow** serves as the **logical center** to **mediate** these extremes.
- The **railroad** and **road signal system** is a **transformation** of the **Universal Colour Code**, which reflects the **structure of the mind**.

### Critique by **Frederick Gamst** (1975)
- **Frederick Gamst** challenges **Leach**’s analysis by examining the **historical development** of **signal systems**:
  - All **traffic signal systems** share a **common point of origin** in **19th century England**.
  - Various **colors**, including **white**, **black**, and **blue**, were **experimented** with during the development of **signal systems**.
  - **Signal systems** vary across **places** and **times**, undermining the idea of a **universal structure** tied to the **color spectrum**.
