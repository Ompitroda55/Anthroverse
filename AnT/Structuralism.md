# Contributions of **Claude Lévi-Strauss**

## Overview of Academic Standing
* Recognized as the most distinguished exponent of **social anthropology** outside the English-speaking world.
* Contrasts with **functionalist** anthropologists in Britain and the United States, who follow the style and tradition of **Malinowski**.

## Intellectual Focus
* Primary concern: Establishing facts about the **human mind**, rather than the organization of specific societies or classes of society.
  > His ultimate concern was to establish facts which are true about the human mind, rather than about the organization of any particular society or class of society.
* This focus marks a fundamental difference from functionalist approaches.

## Scholarly Approach and Style
* Characterized as a **strait scholar intellectual** from the outset of his career.
* Sociological theories noted for:
  * **Baffling complexity**
  * **Overwhelming erudition**
* Some readers perceive his work as potentially a **confidence trick** due to its complexity, yet his **academic importance** remains unquestioned.

## Structuralist Methodology
* Developed a **structural approach** to anthropology, influenced by linguistic theories of:
  * **Troubetzkoy**
  * **Sapir**
* This approach emphasizes underlying structures in cultural and social phenomena, drawing parallels with linguistic models.

# Structural Linguistics

## Overview
* **Structural linguistics** focuses on the **structural analysis of language**, examining the underlying systems that govern linguistic expression.

## Core Aspects of Language
All languages consist of two primary aspects:
* **Phonological aspect** (**Phonology**)
* **Grammatical aspect** (**Grammar**)

### Phonology
* Definition: The study of **phonemes**, the basic units of language, and the **rules governing sequences** of phonemes.
* Key Characteristics:
  * **Phonemes** are finite, typically ranging between **30 and 45** in number across languages.

### Grammar
* Definition: The study of **morphemes** (recurring sequences of phonemes that carry meaning) and the **rules governing their sequences**.
* Key Characteristics:
  * **Morphemes** are potentially infinite in number, forming the meaningful units composed of phonemes.
  * Includes both **free** and **bound** morphemes, which constitute the language’s **lexicon**.

## Components of Language Structure
Every language comprises:
* A **finite set of phonemes**.
* A **set of rules** governing phoneme combinations.
* A **large number of morphemes** (free and bound) forming the **lexicon**.
* A **finite number of arrangements** dictating how morphemes combine to produce **intelligible utterances**.

> Hence, structure of a language combines all these items, in terms of which any utterance current may be described.

## Analytical Process
* Objective: Analyze and discover the **logic of linguistic structures**.
* Process: Linguists examine how phonemes, morphemes, and their rules interact to form meaningful utterances.

## **Noam Chomsky**’s Contribution
* Theory: **Generative Transformational Grammar**
* Core Concept: Sentences in any language consist of:
  * **Deep structure**: The underlying framework of basic phonemes, constructed swiftly and unconsciously.
  * **Surface structure**: The complete sentence, a complex web of transformed and integrated units derived from the deep structure.
  
  > According to him any sentence in any language comprises of a deep structure and a surface structure. Any utterance is built-up swiftly and unconsciously from certain basic phonemes that make up the deep structure.

* Analytical Method:
  * Phonemes are analyzed into **distinctive features**.
  * These features are grouped into **pairs of opposition**.
  * The process of transformation from **deep structure** to **surface structure** varies by language, influenced by:
    * **Conventions**
    * **Habits**
    * **Cultural adaptations** of societies.

## **N. Troubetzkoy**’s Framework
* Structural linguistics is based on four key operations:
  1. Studying the **unconscious linguistic structure**.
  2. Treating terms as a **set of relations**, not in isolation.
  3. Introducing the concept of **system**, demonstrating concrete **phonemic systems** and their structure.
  4. Aiming to discover **linguistic laws**.

> N. Troubetzkoy says that structural linguistic is based on four operations—1. The study of unconscious linguistic structure. 2. The treatment of terms not as isolated, but as a set of relations. 3. It introduces the concept of system—it shows concrete phonemic systems and elucidates their structure. 4. It aims at discovering law.

# Views of **Claude Lévi-Strauss** on Structuralism and Kinship

## Linguistics as a Social Science
* **Linguistics** is considered a **social science**, uniquely achieving the status of a **full science** among social studies.
  > According to Levi-Strauss linguistics itself is a social science, but it is only one among all the social studies, to have attained the status of a full science.

## Interconnection Between Linguistics and Anthropology
* The distinction between **kinship terminology** and **kinship structures** has shifted focus away from the **structural aspects of language** in kinship studies.
* To study **kinship structure**, understanding the **structure of language** is essential.
* In **historical and social-linguistics**, progress requires **anthropological data**.
  > Similarly there are areas of historical and social-linguistics in which linguist cannot make progress without utilizing anthropological data.

## Structural Linguistics Methodology
* **Lévi-Strauss** identifies four basic operations of **structural linguistics**:
  1. Shifting focus from **conscious linguistic phenomena** to their **unconscious infrastructure**.
  2. Emphasizing **relations between terms** rather than treating terms as **isolated entities**.
  3. Employing the concept of **systems**.
  4. Aiming to discover **general laws**.
  > According to Levi-Strauss, the methods of structural linguistic may be reduced to four basic operations: Firstly it shifts its attention from the study of conscious linguistic phenomena to the study of their infrastructure, which is unconscious. Secondly, it does not concern itself with linguistic terms as distinct or isolated entries, but rather with the relations between terms. Thirdly, it employs the concept of systems. Fourthly, it aims at discovering general laws.

## Application to Kinship Studies
* **Kinship terms**, like **phonemes**, gain meaning only when integrated into **systems**.
* **Kinship systems**, akin to **phonemic systems**, are constructed by the **mind** at the level of **unconscious thought**.
* Recurring patterns in **kinship patterns**, **marriage rules**, and **prescribed attitudes** across diverse societies suggest **general but implicit laws**.
  > If we examine kinship terms, like phonemes, they acquire meaning only if they are integrated into systems. Kinship systems like phonemes systems are built by the mind on the level of unconscious thought.
  > Finally the recurrence of kinship patterns, marriage rules, prescribed attitudes between certain types of relations and so forth either in scattered regions of globe on in fundamentally different societies lead us to believe that in case of both kinship as well as linguistics the observable phenomena result from the action of laws, which are general but implicit.

* **Kinship phenomena** and **linguistic phenomena** are of the **same type**, despite belonging to different aspects of reality.
* The relationship between **anthropological** and **linguistic methods** is **analogous**, but with limitations:
  * Analyzing **kinship terms** as phenomena (breaking them into components) results in a system more **abstract** and **complex** than the empirical data.
  > Thus, although these belong to other aspect of reality, kinship phenomena are of same type as linguistic phenomena. Hence, according to Levi-Strauss the relationship between methods of anthropology and linguistics is one of the analogy but there are also some limitations.

## Characteristics of Kinship Terminology
* Key characteristics to consider:
  a. **Kinship terms** are **parts of speech** and must be analyzed using **linguistic methods**.
  b. **Linguistic structuralism** is not directly applicable to kinship terms at the **vocabulary level**.
  c. **Kinship terms** as vocabulary elements are not inherently amenable to **structural treatment**.
  d. The **kinship system of terminology** includes a **system of attitudes** (e.g., **respect**, **familiarity**, **rights**, **obligations**, **affection**, **hostility**).
  e. The **system of terminology** and **system of attitudes** are **functionally related** but not necessarily **coterminous**, and often diverge in practice.
  > The kinship terms by definition are also parts of speech and MUST BE treated directly by method of linguistics. ... The system of terminology and system of attitude need that necessarily be coterminus, and in practice they frequently are not, although they are functionally, related.

* Applying **structural linguistics** to the **theory of attitudes** could elevate it to a **generalizable** and **analytically valuable level**.
  > Levi-Strauss believes that the application of formal method of structural linguistics in the theory of attitude may provide the means of elevating such a theory to a generalizable and analytically valuable level.

## Analysis of the Avuncular Relationship
* The **avuncular relationship** illustrates **structural principles**:
  * **Kinship** is a **language**, functioning as a **semantic system**, similar to **art** and other cultural aspects.
  * Like **language**, **kinship**, **art**, and other cultural systems are **symbolic systems** with **semantic functions**, though these may be **fragmentary** or **subjective**.
  * The **structural principles** or **grammars** of these systems are largely **unconscious** but can be elucidated with the **correct method**.
  > The first of these is that a kinship is a language. Language is a semantic system – so kinship, art and other aspects of culture may also claim to be systems with semantic function even though such function may be fragmentary or subjective.
  > The second point is that the structural principle or grammars of such systems are largely unconscious, although this does not prevent them from being elucidated by correct method.

* Implication: All forms of **social life** share a **substantially similar nature**, reflecting **universal laws** that regulate **unconscious mental activities**.
  > The corollary of this is that we may be able to show that all forms of social life are substantially of same nature. As the projection on the level of conscious and civilized thought, they provide illustration of the universal laws, which regulate the unconscious activities of the mind.

## Incest Taboo and Cultural Systems
* In his book, **Elementary Structure of Kinship (1949)**, **Lévi-Strauss** discusses the **incest taboo**:
  * Empirically universal across societies, though **specific rules** vary by **society** or **culture**.
  * **Social functions** exist but do not explain its **origin**, as early humans could not have foreseen its advantages.
  * The **incest taboo** stems from the human mind’s tendency to think in **opposites**, particularly the dichotomy between **self** and **others**.
  > Regarding incest taboo it has been empirically established that it appears in every society, though specific rules differ from society to society or culture to culture. ... Instead, incest taboo ultimately depends upon the property of human mind to think in opposites.

* This dichotomy enables **true symbolic communication**, which operates on three levels:
  1. **Exchange of messages**
  2. **Exchange of goods**
  3. **Exchange of women**
  > The communication is reciprocal exchange that takes place on three fundamental levels: (i) Exchange of message (ii) Exchange of goods (iii) Exchange of women.

* **Incest taboos** regulate the **exchange of women**, distinguishing human societies from animals where mating is **random** and **promiscuous**.
* The taboo enforces an **ordered exchange of women**, instituting **marriage rules** and initiating a cycle of **reciprocal exchanges** across all three levels.
  > According to him incest taboos are concerned with exchange of women. Among animals mating is random and promiscuous but incest taboo, by its very nature, dictates on ordered exchange of woman, and thus also institutes marriage rules.

* The **nature vs. culture** dichotomy, marked by the **incest taboo**, is a fundamental structure present in cultural systems like:
  * **Totemism**
  * **Myth**
  * **Art**
  * **Ritual**
  * Naming practices (e.g., **pet names**)
  > Incest taboo thus, marks the differences between nature and culture—the most basic dichotomy is present in many cultural systems, such as totemism, myth, art, ritual and the way in which people name their pets.

# **Claude Lévi-Strauss** on **Totemism**

## Overview from *Totemism* (1962)
* In his book **Totemism (1962)**, **Lévi-Strauss** explores **totemism** as a system where **animals** and **objects** serve as **symbols** for **clans** or **families**.
* Purpose: To order **social relationships** between groups using **linguistic** and **classificatory devices**.
* Expresses the relationship between **nature** and **culture**.
  > In this book he attempted to reveal that animals and objects are selected as symbols of clans or families because they are useful as linguistic and classificatory devices to order social relationship between groups. It also expresses the relationship between nature and culture.

## Critique of Earlier Totemist Theories
* **Lévi-Strauss** criticizes earlier **totemists** for two key errors:
  1. Assuming a **direct relationship** between **totem** and **man** based on **contiguity**, whereas the relationship is **masked** or **metaphorical**.
  2. Ignoring the **opposition** between **personal** and **collective** relations with the **totem**.
* Earlier theories incorrectly linked **totemic institutions** strictly to **exogamy rules**.
  > Criticising the earlier totemists, he pointed out that they had committed two mistakes. 1. They assumed the relationship between the totem and man as a direct one based on contiguity, whereas, according to him, it is always masked or metaphorical. 2. They ignored the opposition between personal and collective relation with totem.

## Clarifying the Concept of **Totemism**
* **Lévi-Strauss** argues that **totemism** is often misunderstood, conflating two distinct problems:
  1. The **identification of humans** with **plants** or **animals**, relating to general views of **man and nature**.
  2. The **designation of kinship-based groups**, which may use **animal** or **vegetable terms** but can also employ other naming methods.
* **Totemism** only applies when these two orders **coincide**.
  > He opines that the term totemism covers only cases in which there is coincidence of two orders.

## Key Questions in **Totemism**
* **Lévi-Strauss** poses two central questions:
  1. Why are **animal** and **vegetable species** selected to provide a **nomenclature** for a **social system**?
  2. What kinds of **relationships** exist between **animal/plant species** and the **social system**?
* Answer: The selection is not merely due to their **availability** in the **natural environment** but reflects the **mode of thought** of the **human mind**.
  > The link between man and nature is not direct but passing through human mind.

## Structural Method for Analysis
* To elucidate **totemism**, **Lévi-Strauss** proposes a **structural method** with three operations:
  1. Define the phenomenon as a **relation** between two or more **terms** (real or supposed).
  2. Construct a **table of possible permutations** between these terms.
  3. Use the resulting table as the **object of analysis** to reveal **necessary connections**, as empirical phenomena are **contingent**.
  > To elucidate this he has suggested application of structure method which includes three operations: (i) We may define the phenomenon under study as a relation between two or more terms, real or supposed. (ii) We must construct a table of possible permutations between these terms. (iii) The resulting table is to be taken as the several object of analysis because at this level only it can yield the necessary connections, the empirical phenomena being contingent.

## Structural Framework of **Totemism**
* **Totemism** involves **relations** posed by **ideology** between two series:
  * **Natural series**: Comprising **categories** and **particulars**.
  * **Cultural series**: Comprising **groups** and **persons**.
* These terms associate in four ways:
  | **Nature**   | **Culture** | **Description**                                                                 |
  |--------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | **Category** | **Groups**  | Social and sexual totems (e.g., Australian tribes, where a **natural category** of animal relates to a **cultural group** like a moiety). |
  | **Category** | **Person**  | Individual totem (e.g., North-American Indian identifying with a **natural category** via physical traits). |
  | **Particular**| **Person**  | Totemism in Mota (Banks Islands), where a child is believed to be the **incarnation** of an **animal** or **plant** consumed by the mother during pregnancy awareness. |
  | **Particular**| **Group**   | A **natural species** protected by a **social group** (e.g., among Mooris).      |
  > The natural series comprises – categories and particular while the cultural series comprises groups and person. The association of these terms may be elucidated in following four ways...

## Scope of **Totemism**
* Only the first two combinations (**Category-Groups**, **Category-Person**) strictly fall under **totemism**.
* The other two (**Particular-Person**, **Particular-Group**) are **totemic illusions**, resulting from a **distortion of the semantic field** due to a mistaken division of reality.
* **Totemism** is a specific expression of **correlations** and **oppositions** using a **nomenclature** of **animal** and **plant names**.
  > According to him only first two combinations come under the sphere of totemism. In the case of rest two, the totemic illusions are the result of distortion of semantic field, which results from a mistaken division of reality.

## Core Principle: “Good to Think”
* **Natural species** are chosen not because they are **good to eat** but because they are **good to think**.
* Their **perceptual reality** enables the embodiment of **ideas** and **relations** conceived through **speculative thought** based on **empirical observation**.
  > In totemism natural species are chosen not because they are good to eat but because they are good to think, their perceptual reality permits the embodiment of ideas and relations conceived by speculative thought on the basis of empirical observation.

## Conclusion
* **Lévi-Strauss** does not dissolve the problem of **totemism** but elevates it to the **plane of logic** rather than **fact**.
* He is described as a **mental totamist**, not a **non-totamist**, emphasizing the **logical structures** underlying **totemic systems**.
  > Thus Levi-Strauss has not dissolved the problem of totemism. He has merely lifted it to the plane of logic, rather than of fact. He is a mental totamist, not a non-totamist.

# **Claude Lévi-Strauss**: Structural Analysis of **Myth**

## Characteristics of **Myth**

1. **Linguistic Nature**
   * **Myth** is inherently **linguistic**, embodying the dual characteristics of **langue** and **parole** as defined by **Saussure**:
     * **Langue**: The **structural** and **reversible** aspect of language, representing its underlying system.
     * **Parole**: The **statistical** and **non-reversible** aspect, pertaining to individual expressions.
   > Myth is linguistic; therefore it possesses the characteristics of Langue and Parole (Saussure’s distinction that myth like language is both langue (the structural & reversible aspect) and Parole (the statistic and non-reversible aspect).

2. **Timeless Quality**
   * **Myth** transcends **time limits**, applying equally to the **past**, **present**, and **future**.
   * The **pattern of events** or **attitudes** described is not confined to a historical context.
   > Myth may also be distinguished by a third characteristic that the pattern of events or attitudes described is beyond time limit * historical or applies to present, past and future equally.

3. **Distinction from Poetry**
   * **Myth** differs from **poetry** in its translatability:
     * **Poetry**: Cannot be translated without **serious distortion** due to its dependence on **style**, **music**, and **syntax**.
     * **Myth**: Retains its **mythical value** even through the **worst translation**, as its essence lies in the **story** itself.
   > Levi-Strauss attempts to distinguish Myth from Poetry. Poetry is a kind of speech which cannot be translated, except at the cost of serious distortion, whereas the mythical value in the myth is preserved, even through the worst translation.

4. **Essence in Narrative**
   * The **substance of myth** resides in the **story** it tells, not in its **style**, **original music**, or **syntax**.
   > The substance of myth does not lie in its style, its original music or its syntax, but in the story which it tells.

# **Claude Lévi-Strauss**: Structural Analysis of **Myth**

## Motivation for Studying **Myth**
* **Lévi-Strauss** pursued the **nature of the unconscious mind** through **myth**, as **myth-making** is the human activity closest to the **unconscious**.
* Unlike **kinship systems**, **marriage rules**, or **village organization**, which are influenced by **social contingencies**, **myth** is primarily constrained by its own **inherent principles**, not **social utility**.
  > Myth-making is nearest to the unconscious. The myth-making mind is constrained mainly by its own inherent principles and not by social utility.

## Methodology in Structural Analysis
* In his article, **‘The Structural Study of Myth’ (1963)**, **Lévi-Strauss** analyzed various versions of the **Oedipus myth**:
  * **Myth** should not be read as a **story** but broken down into its basic units, called **mythemes**.
  * The **relationships** between these **mythemes** must be examined to reveal the myth’s structure.
  > The myth is not to be read as a story, but must be broken down into its basic units i.e. mythemes and then the relationship between these mythemes must be examined.

* In his four-volume work, **Mythologiques (1964, 1966, 1968, 1972)**, he expanded this method:
  * **The Raw & the Cooked (1969)**: Analyzed **187 South American myths**.
  * Subsequent volumes examined **600 Indian myths**.
  * Despite differences in **content**, **Lévi-Strauss** demonstrated that their **underlying structures** share **significant similarities**.
  * He likened myths to an **orchestral score**, where each myth (instrument) varies but contributes to a **structural whole**.
  > Together they are like an Orchestral Score, where each instrument sounds something different, but what kind of sound it makes is part of a structural whole.

## Analytical Approach
* Differences between myths are reconciled by analyzing them in terms of **simple oppositions**, with the **nature vs. culture** dichotomy being prominent.
* **Mythemes** are **translated**, **transposed**, and **transformed** to reveal their **common structural significance**.
  > The differences between myths are brought into harmony by analysing them in terms of relatively simple oppositions, among which, that between nature and culture figures quite prominently.

## Propositions on **Myth** Structure
* **Lévi-Strauss** outlines the following propositions for the structural analysis of **myth**:
  1. **Meaning** in **mythology** lies not in **isolated elements** but in how these elements are **combined**.
     > If there is a meaning to be found in mythology, it cannot reside in the isolated elements, which enter into the composition of myth, but only in the way those elements are combined.
  2. **Myth** is a form of **language** but has **specific properties** when used mythically.
     > Although myth belongs to the same category as language, being a part of it, language in its mythic uses has certain specific properties.
  3. These properties are **more complex** than those in other **linguistic expressions**, existing **above the ordinary linguistic level**.
     > These properties are more complex than those found in any other kind of linguistic expression i.e. they exist above the ordinary linguistic level.
  4. **Myth** is composed of **units**, similar to language.
     > Myth, like rest of language, is constituted out of units.
  5. These **mythic units** (termed **gross constituent units**) are more complex than basic linguistic units like **phonemes**, as they consist of **relations**.
     * The true units of **myth** are **bundles of relations**, which are combined to produce **meaning**.
     > The units, while they presuppose the constituent units of language (phonemes etc.), differ from these that the mythic units are of higher and more complex level. ... Each Gross constituent unit will consist of a relation.

* **Mythemes** represent the **nature-culture dichotomy**, often linked to the **incest taboo**.
  > They represent the nature-culture dichotomy hanging on the incest taboo.

## Examples of Structural Transformations
* **Lévi-Strauss** illustrates how seemingly different **mythemes** share structural roles:
  * **Honey**:
    * Always consumed **raw**, representing **nature**.
    * **Enticing** and **seductive**, so myths about **seduction** align structurally with **honey**.
  * **Ashes**, **fire**, **tobacco**, and **wild pig’s meat**:
    * **Ashes** and **fire** signify **culture**, as fire is a human invention.
    * **Tobacco** requires **fire** for consumption, and **wild pig’s meat** is never eaten **uncooked**.
    * Myths about **tobacco**, **wild pig**, **fire**, **ashes**, **cooking**, **smoke**, or **burning** share structural similarities.
  > Since honey is always consumed raw, it represents nature. But honey is also enticing and seductive and hence all myths dealing with seduction stand in the same structural position as honey. Ashes, however are produced by fire. Fire is one of man’s earliest inventions, and both ashes and fire signify culture.

* Note: These transformations can appear **arbitrary** or **far-fetched** due to their complexity.
  > Though Levi-Strauss does this with great elegance and eloquence the transformation often appears arbitrary and far fetched.

# **Claude Lévi-Strauss**: *The Raw & the Cooked*

## Structural Analysis of Food Preparation
* **Lévi-Strauss** posits that meals have a **structure**, conveying **messages** through **foods** and their **modes of preparation**.
* All **cultures** embed meanings in the way food is prepared and presented.
  > Levi-Strauss was struck by the idea that meals have a structure. ALL cultures send out messages of the foods, and in the modes of preparation.

## Categories of Cooked Food
* Within **cooked foods**, the main **structural components** reflect a dichotomy between **nature** and **culture**:
  * **Boiled food**:
    * Represents **culture**.
    * Requires a **container** and a **barrier of water** between the food and the **fire**.
    * Associated with **endocuisine**: Prepared for **domestic use**, intended for a **small closed group** (e.g., **boiled chicken** for family meals in former France).
  * **Roasted food**:
    * Represents **nature**.
    * Involves **direct contact** between food and **flame**.
    * Associated with **exocuisine**: Offered to **guests** (e.g., **roasted meat** for banquets in former France).
  > THE boiled can most often be ascribed to what might be called an endocuisine: prepared for domestic use, destined to a small closed group, while the roasted belong to exocuisine, that which one offers to guests. Formerly in France, boiled chicken was for the family meal, whole roasted meat was for banquet...

## Structural Formula
* The relationship between **roasted** and **boiled** foods mirrors the **nature vs. culture** dichotomy:
  > Roasted : Boiled :: Nature : Culture

## Application to Cannibalism
* **Lévi-Strauss** used this formula to make predictions about **cannibalism practices**.
* **Paul Shankman (1969)** disagreed with the formula based on his own study, challenging its applicability.
  > Levi-Strauss attempted to predict about practices of cannibalism on the basis of this formula. Paul Shankaman (1969) on the basis of his study, placed his disagreement on this formula.

# **Edmund Leach**: Traffic Signals and Structural Analysis

## Leach’s Theory on Traffic Signals
* **Leach** argues that **traffic signal systems** (for railways and roads) reflect a **universal structure of the mind**:
  * **Green** means **go**, **red** means **stop**, and **yellow**, as an intermediate signal, is chosen because it lies **midway between green and red** in the **spectrum**.
  * The **color system** and the **signal system** share the **same structure**, with one being a **transformation** of the other.
  > “With traffic lights on both railways and roads, green means go and red means stop, if we want to devise further signal with an intermediate meaning, we choose the colour yellow. We do this because, in the spectrum it lies midway between green and red...the colour system and the signal system have the same structure: the one is a transformation of the other”—Leach.

* The **mind** processes the **spectrum** by:
  * **Dichotomizing** it into a **binary opposition** (e.g., **green** vs. **red**).
  * Using the **extremes** to form the opposition and the **logical center** (e.g., **yellow**) to **mediate** between them.
* The **road and railway signal system** is a **transformation** of the **Universal Color Code**, which reflects the **structure of the mind**.
  > LEACH feels that the mind dichotomizes the spectrum, makes a binary opposition out of a continuum. It will use the extremes to build that opposition and the logical centre to mediate those extremes.

## Criticism by **Frederick Gamst** (1975)
* **Gamst** challenges **Leach**’s theory by tracing the historical development of **traffic signal systems**:
  * All **traffic signal systems** share a **common origin** in **19th century England**.
  * Various colors, including **white**, **black**, and **blue**, were **experimented with** during the development of signal systems.
  * **Signal systems** vary across **places** and **times**, undermining the idea of a universal structure.
  > FREDERICK Gamst (1975) criticising Leach’s example, states that all traffic signal systems have a common point of origin in 19th century England. He found, after analysing the history of signal systems that in the development of signal system, many colours including white, black and blue were used and experimented upon. It is also the fact that signal system varies from place to place & time to time.
