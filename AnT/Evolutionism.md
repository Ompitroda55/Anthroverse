# Evolutionism

### Overview of **Cultural Evolutionism**

* The **Evolutionary School of Thought**, specifically **classical or 19th century cultural evolutionism**, posits that culture develops in a uniform and progressive manner.
* Most societies are believed to pass through the same series of stages, ultimately reaching a common end.

### Historical Context and Emergence

* **Cultural evolutionism** emerged during a period when Charles Darwin’s theory of **Organic Evolution** gained significant popularity.
* Darwin’s book, *Origin of Species* (1859), marked a pivotal moment in the development of evolutionary theories.

### Relationship with Darwinism

* There is no scholarly consensus on the influence of **Darwinism** on **cultural evolutionism**.
* Taggart strongly opposes the view that Darwin’s work significantly shaped cultural evolutionism, stating:
  > Origin of Species, which appeared in 1859, was too late to cast hardly an influence upon the evolutionary schemes of cultural evolutionism.
* Key writings by 19th century cultural evolutionists, such as **Tylor** and **Morgan**, were published between 1861 and 1865.
* This timeline suggests that the framework of **cultural evolutionism** was developed concurrently with Darwin’s research and writing.

## What is Evolution?

### Definition of **Evolution**

* **Evolution** is defined as a process in which different forms are produced or developed orderly in a system.
* It involves continuous progress within a system, leading to:
  * Complexity from simplicity
  * Heterogeneity from homogeneity
  * Certainty from uncertainty

### Application in Anthropology

* **Evolutionists** have utilized **evolution** as a methodology to reconstruct the history of mankind.

### Dimensions of **Evolution** in Human Beings

* **Evolution** in the context of human beings can be perceived from two dimensions:
  * **Biological or Organic Evolution**
  * **Cultural Evolution**

## Evolutionary School of Anthropological Thought

### Overview

* The **Evolutionary School of Thought** is divided into two main groups based on the doctrines of **Cultural Evolution** they propose:
  * **Classical Evolutionary School**
  * **Neo-Evolutionary School**

### Classical Evolutionary School

* The **Classical Evolutionary School** is further divided into three sub-schools based on regional distinctions:

**British Evolutionary School Pioneers:**
  * **E.B. Tylor**
  * **H.J.S. Maine**
  * **J.F. McLennan**
  * **S.J.G. Frazer**

**American Evolutionary School Pioneer:**
  * **L.H. Morgan**

**German Evolutionary School Pioneers:**
  * **J.J. Bachofen**
  * **A. Bastian**

### Neo-Evolutionary School

* The **Neo-Evolutionary School** is divided into two sub-categories based on nationality:

**British School Pioneer:**
  * **V.G. Childe**

**American School Pioneers:**
  * **Leslie A. White**
  * **Julian H. Steward**

## Classical Evolutionary School: 19th Century Evolutionists

### Basic Assumptions

**1. Unilinear Cultural Evolution**

* The **Unilinear Cultural Evolution** scheme postulates that the culture or cultures of the world progress through different successive developmental stages in a unilinear fashion.

**2. Direction and Characteristics of Evolution**

* The direction of **evolution** is characterized as moving:
  * From simple to complex
  * From similarity to dissimilarity
  * From indefinite to definite
* It is assumed that genuine **cultural parallels** or **cultural similarities** develop independently in all cultures within historical sequences.
* The development of **cultural parallels** is attributed to:
  * Man’s ability to invent new things and ideas
  * The **Psychic Unity of Mankind**

## Psychic Unity of Mankind

### Cultural Similarities and Evolutionary Challenges

* **Evolutionists** faced challenges in explaining similarities in **culture traits**, **culture complexes**, and **culture patterns** across different parts of the world without known historical connections.
* Examples of such similarities include:
  1. The simultaneous invention of agriculture in **South-East Asia**, **South-West Asia**, and **America**.
  2. The concurrent invention of the use of zero in **India**, **Babylonia**, and **Maya**.

### Explanations for Cultural Similarities

* Two possible explanations for these similarities were considered:
  1. **Independent Invention**
  2. **Diffusion**
* **Evolutionists** found the theory of **diffusion** unconvincing and instead attributed similarities to **independent parallel invention** or discoveries.
* This led to the concept of **Cultural Parallels**, also termed **Cultural Parallelism**, which is synonymous with **cultural similarism**.

### Role of Psychic Unity of Mankind

* **Evolutionists** postulated that **Cultural Parallels** arose due to the **Psychic Unity of Mankind**.
* **Psychic Unity of Mankind** refers to a similar mental state among human beings that causes them to react similarly in comparable environmental situations at a particular period of time.
* This concept explains why human beings in different parts of the world progressed through similar developmental stages: **savagery**, **barbarism**, and **civilization**.
* The examples of **Cultural Parallels** (e.g., agriculture and the use of zero) demonstrate that human beings possess **Psychic Unity**.

### Cultural Development and Complexity

* **Classical evolutionists** argued that all cultures initially possessed similar and simple **culture traits**.
* Over time, these traits gradually developed into more complex forms due to **cultural developments**.

## Salient Features of Classical Evolutionism

### Unilinear Evolution of Culture

* **Human culture** as a whole, or **socio-cultural institutions**, evolves in a **unilinear manner**, progressing stage after stage.

### Direction of Cultural Evolution

* The direction of **cultural evolution** is characterized as moving:
  1. From simple to complex
  2. From homogeneity to heterogeneity
  3. From indefinite to definite

### Basis of Developmental Stages

* Different stages of **cultural development** are based on **historical explanations**, utilizing methods such as:
  1. **Museuology**
  2. **Comparative method**

### Cultural Similarities and Their Causes

* Similarities in **cultural traits** or **complexes** are attributed to:
  1. **Parallel inventions**
  2. **Psychic Unity of Mankind**

### Concept of Survivals

* **Survivals** in both **material** and **non-material** aspects of culture serve as proof of earlier conditions.
* Definition of **Survivals**:
  > Survivals are processes, customs and opinions that persist by force of habit, even when they lose their utility.

## General Contribution of Classical Evolutionists

### 1. Application of Evolutionary Schemes

* **Classical Evolutionists** utilized **evolutionary schemes** as a methodology to:
  * Reconstruct the **culture growth** of mankind as a whole.
  * Establish **unilinear developmental sequences** to generalize cultural phenomena.
* They also aimed to establish developmental sequences for specific **cultural institutions**, such as:
  1. **Marriage**
  2. **Family**

### 2. Use of the Comparative Method

* **Classical Evolutionists** employed the **comparative method** to:
  * Compare the early stages of **primitive people** with those of **civilized ones**, concluding that the former reflected the early stages of the latter.
  * Examine **survivals**, which they considered indicators of the conditions of **culture of mankind** in earlier periods.
* **Survivals** were defined as elements of culture that persist as indicators of past conditions.
* The **comparative method** involved comparing **worldwide cultures** or **cultural institutions** to identify patterns and stages of development.

## Contribution of Classical Evolutionists

### Overview of Evolutionary Schemes

* **Classical Evolutionists** applied **evolutionary schemes** to reconstruct the developmental stages of:
  * **Culture of mankind** as a whole.
  * Specific **cultural institutions**, including:
    * **Marriage**
    * **Family**
    * **Kinship**
    * **Religion**
* Their approach relied on the **comparative method**.

### Cultural Evolution Stages

* **Tylor** and **Morgan** postulated that mankind progressed through three main stages of **cultural evolution**:
  * **Savagery**
  * **Barbarism**
  * **Civilization**

**1. Tylor’s Contribution**

* **Tylor** did not assign specific cultures to distinct stages of **cultural development**.

**2. Morgan’s Contribution**

* **Morgan** further subdivided the stages of **Savagery** and **Barbarism** into three sub-periods each:
  1. **Lower**
  2. **Middle**
  3. **Upper**
* **Morgan’s classification** of developmental stages in terms of **ethnic periods** corresponds to anthropological categories:
  1. **Savagery**: Hunting and food-gathering societies
  2. **Barbarism**: Horticulturalists
  3. **Civilization**: Pre* or proto-state societies

## Evaluation of Classical Evolutionary Scheme

### Contributions of Classical Evolutionists

* **Classical Evolutionists** laid the foundation for **theoretical anthropology**, providing a cornerstone for anthropological thought and inspiring further research and theoretical development.
* They viewed **primitives or tribal societies** as the ancestors of **modern civilized societies**, suggesting that the former represent earlier stages from which the latter evolved.
* This perspective challenged notions of **racial superiority**, despite accusations of **ethnocentrism**.
* Their **historical** and **comparative approach** remains relevant for understanding contemporary **cultural phenomena** in relation to the past.

**Reconstruction of Cultural History**

* In the absence of **written records**, reconstructing the evolution of **cultural aspects** was challenging.
* **Classical Evolutionists** relied on their **critical and analytical minds** to:
  * Survey existing literature from **travellers**, **missionaries**, and **ethnographers**.
  * Reconstruct the history of **cultural institutions** and **culture as a whole**.
* Where written accounts were unavailable, they applied the concept of **cultural survivals** to address missing links.

**Use of Survivals**

* They compared **survivals** (both **material** and **non-material**) to establish developmental sequences characterized by:
  * Progression from simple to complex.
  * Shift from homogeneity to heterogeneity.
  * Movement from uncertainty to certainty.

### Criticisms of Classical Evolutionism

* Despite their contributions, **Classical Evolutionists** faced significant criticism from:
  1. **Particularists**
  2. **Diffusionists**
  3. **Migrationists**
* These critics discredited the fundamental postulates of **evolutionists** based on their **empirical findings**.
* Nevertheless, the pioneering work of **Classical Evolutionists** remains a significant milestone in the fields of **anthropology**, particularly **cultural** and **social anthropology**.
