# Neo-Evolutionary School: A Revised Approach to Cultural Evolution

### Background and Criticism of Classical Evolutionism
The **Classical Evolutionists** of the 19th century faced significant criticism from 20th-century **Diffusionists** and **Relativists**, who challenged their theories based on empirical data. Key points of critique include:

* **Rejection of Psychic Unity and Parallel Inventions**: Critics argued that human beings were generally **uninventive** and had an **unlimited capacity to adopt or imitate** cultural traits from other societies.
* **Role of Diffusion**: The qualitative change in a society’s cultural form was attributed to the **diffusion** of invented traits from other societies, rather than independent development.
* **Opposition to Unilinear Evolution**: Diffusionists and Relativists disfavored the idea of a **unilinear sequence** of cultural evolution, which Classical Evolutionists had proposed.

### Emergence of the Neo-Evolutionary Scheme
In response to these criticisms, 20th-century evolutionists developed a new framework known as the **Neo-Evolutionary scheme** to address the shortcomings of earlier theories. This revised approach aimed to refine the understanding of cultural evolution while maintaining its core principles.

> The Neo-Evolutionary scheme was proposed to remove the shortcomings of Classical Evolutionism and incorporate empirical insights from critics.

### Key Figures in Neo-Evolutionism
The **Neo-Evolutionists** who played a pivotal role in shaping this new scheme include:

* **V. Gordon Childe** (Britain)
* **Leslie A. White** (America)
* **Julian H. Steward** (America)

These scholars are recognized for their significant contributions to the development and promotion of the **Neo-Evolutionary** framework.

## A. V. Gordon Childe’s Contributions to British Neo-Evolutionary School

### Background and Approach
**V. Gordon Childe**, a trained archaeologist, sought to revive the **Evolutionary Scheme** by analyzing materials collected from East and Europe. His work focused on the **evolution of culture** and was heavily influenced by the **unilinear evolution** concepts of **E.B. Tylor** and **Lewis H. Morgan**. Childe’s key publication, *Social Evolution*, outlines his perspective on cultural development.

> Childe was a devout follower of the concept of unilinear evolution of classical evolutionists, emphasizing the general evolution of mankind or culture as a whole.

### Major Cultural Events
Childe identified three pivotal events that shaped cultural evolution:

* **Invention of Food Production**
* **Urbanization**
* **Industrialization**

By analyzing the transitions driven by these events, Childe delineated common factors in the **evolutionary process**.

## Archaeological Periods and Cultural Sequences
Unlike **Morgan**, Childe proposed a unique sequence of cultural development, aligning more closely with **Tylor**’s framework. His sequences avoided associating specific cultural groups with ethnic periods, focusing instead on mankind as a whole passing through successive cultural stages: **savagery**, **barbarism**, and **civilization**. His proposed sequence includes:

| **Archaeological Period** | **Cultural Development** |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Paleolithic Period        | Savagery                |
| Neolithic Period         |                         |
| Copper Age               | Higher Barbarism        |
| Early Bronze Age         | Civilization            |

> Childe’s cultural sequences were so general that they were neither arguable nor very useful, as noted by critics.

### Universal Evolution and Cultural Characteristics
Childe’s approach, termed **universal evolution** by **Julian Steward**, resembled the **unilinear sequence** of 19th-century evolutionists in its broad generalizations but differed in its treatment of specifics. His focus was on **culture** and the general evolution of mankind. Key characteristics of his cultural stages include:

* **Savagery**: Defined by **hunting and gathering**.
* **Barbarism**: Marked by **plant and animal domestication**, a precondition for larger populations.
* **Civilization**: Characterized by:
  * Large populations and **cities**.
  * **Internal social differentiation** and **specialization**.
  * Development of **writing** and **mathematics**.

> No one can dispute that hunting and gathering (which is Childe’s diagnostic of savagery) preceded plant and animal domestication (which is his criterion of Barbarism).

### Technological Development and Environmental Interaction
Childe emphasized that at each stage of **cultural development**, mankind improved **technological skills** to exploit **natural resources**, leading to increasingly aggressive interactions with the environment:

* **Savagery**: Early, less advanced technological skills resulted in minimal environmental impact.
  * **Forest-dwellers** or **cave-dwellers** relied on basic survival techniques.
* **Barbarism**: Adoption of **agriculture** transformed **hunters and gatherers** into **food producers**.
* **Civilization**: Significant advancements included:
  * **House-dwelling** replacing forest or cave habitation.
  * **Urbanization** through the development of **cities**.
  * **Writing** preserved traditions, and **mathematics** aided in resource management.
  * **Technological developments** like smelting **copper**, **bronze**, and **iron** enabled the production of durable **utensils** and **implements**.

> A drastic change in the life pattern of mankind appeared in the civilization stage, in which an aggressive attitude towards the environment developed among mankind.

### Marxist Influence
Childe’s perspective aligned with **Marxist** principles, particularly the belief that **production** and the **tools necessary for production** were fundamental in determining the course of history. This Marxist lens shaped his view of cultural evolution as driven by technological and productive advancements.

## Weaknesses of V. Gordon Childe’s Evolutionary Scheme

The **Neo-Evolutionary** framework proposed by **V. Gordon Childe** faced several criticisms, highlighting limitations in his approach to cultural evolution. The key weaknesses are outlined below:

### 1. Over-Reliance on Archaeological Data
* As an archaeologist, Childe heavily depended on **archaeological data** to formulate his **cultural sequences**, which may have limited the breadth of his analysis.

### 2. Failure to Distinguish Between Historical and Modern Hunters and Gatherers
* Childe did not differentiate between ancient and present-day **hunters and food gatherers**, despite significant differences in their **implements** and **environmental conditions**.

### 3. Limited Geographic Scope
* Childe’s focus was primarily on the **Middle East** and **Europe**, showing a lack of interest in **civilizational sequences** outside these regions.
  * He acknowledged little resemblance between specific steps in the development of **civilization** in Europe.
  * However, he was unprepared to explore parallels in regions like **Mexico** or **Peru**.

### 4. Neglect of Universal Institutions
* Childe failed to consider widespread institutions such as **matriarchy** and **sexual promiscuity**, providing no arguments to justify their exclusion from his evolutionary scheme.

## Leslie A. White

### Academic Background and Influences
* **Leslie A. White** was shaped by key academic figures and institutions:
  * Studied under **Alexander Golden Wiezer** at the **New School** in New York.
  * Influenced by **Franz Boas** during his Ph.D. research at the **University of Chicago**.
* Initially, White was not an evolutionist, as evident in his 1925 article, which echoed a **Boasian** emphasis on **cultural factors** in shaping **personality**.

### Shift Toward Evolutionism
* White’s perspective changed during his two-year tenure at the **University of Buffalo**, where he encountered the works of **Lewis H. Morgan**.
* He was struck by the dismissal of Morgan as a “worthless example of speculative philosophy” and came to regard Morgan as a “remarkable scholar.”
* By 1929, White became a vocal critic of **Boasian historical particularism** and the **psychological reductionism** of others, adopting an **evolutionary** stance.

### Critique of Boasian Anthropology
White sharply criticized **Franz Boas** and his followers, labeling their rejection of the **evolutionary scheme** as both **premature** and **scientifically suspect**:
* **Premature**: Boasians dismissed evolutionary approaches without allowing them sufficient opportunity to yield results.
* **Scientifically Suspect**: They misrepresented the ideas of evolutionists like **Morgan** and **Tylor**.

> In addition to being anti-materialist, they are anti-philosophic and anti-intellectualist and anti-evolutionist. In fact, they are opposed to so many things that someone has characterised their philosophy as eclectic negativism. It has been their mission to demonstrate that there was one law of significance in cultural phenomena, that civilization is the foremost exponent of this philosophy — (White-1949).

### White’s Defense of Evolutionism
* White rejected the **eclectic negativism** he attributed to Boasian philosophy, arguing that it opposed **materialist**, **philosophic**, **intellectualist**, and **evolutionist** perspectives.
* He championed the significance of **cultural phenomena** and viewed **civilization** as a key expression of evolutionary processes, aligning with the principles of **Neo-Evolutionism**.

## Leslie A. White’s Contribution to Evolutionary Theory

### Key Publications
**Leslie A. White** articulated his **Neo-Evolutionist** perspective in two seminal works:
* *The Science of Culture* (1949)
* *The Evolution of Culture* (1959)

These books outline his approach, grounded in **cultural materialism** and expressed in terms of **energy**.

### Core Concept: Cultural Materialism and Energy
White’s evolutionary theory centers on **cultural materialism**, emphasizing the role of **energy** in cultural advancement:
* Cultural progress occurs as:
  * The amount of **energy harnessed per capita per year** increases.
  * The **efficiency or economy** of energy control improves.
  * Or both.

> Cultural advances as the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year increase or as the efficiency or economy of the means of controlling energy is increased or both — White (1959).

* **Early Human Development**: Humans initially relied on **physical strength** as their primary energy source.
* **Introduction of Tools**: Tools increased energy efficiency.
* **Later Stages**: Humans harnessed external energy sources like **fire**, **water**, and **wind** for their purposes.

### Culture as a Survival Mechanism
White viewed **culture** as a **survival mechanism** requiring **energy** to meet human needs:
* Cultural evolution is driven by **technological** and **scientific development**.
* A **socio-cultural system** comprises three components:
  1. **Techno-Economic**
  2. **Social**
  3. **Ideological**

> Culture becomes primarily a mechanism for harnessing energy and of putting it to work in service of man.

### Hierarchical Structure of Cultural Systems
White proposed that the **technological aspect** dominates the **social** and **ideological** aspects, arranged vertically:
* **Technological aspect** (foundation)
* **Sociological aspect**
* **Ideological aspects**

This hierarchy underscores **technological determinism**, where **technological subsystems** control the amount of **energy** captured and utilized, driving **cultural development**.

### Law of Cultural Development
White formalized his theory with the formula:
**E × T = C**
* **E**: Energy
* **T**: Technology
* **C**: Cultural development

* **Energy** is the dynamic force animating cultural systems, while **technology** serves as the framework.
* As **technology** becomes more efficient, more **energy** is harnessed, leading to cultural advancement.

> The operation of this law is potent in the history of man’s cultural development.

### Stages of Cultural Development
White extended the stages proposed by predecessors like **Tylor** and **Morgan** (**savagery**, **barbarism**, **civilization**) by adding:
* **Energy revolution**

### Technological Determinism and Interrelations
White emphasized that the **technological factor** determines the **cultural system** as a whole:
* **Social systems** and **ideologies** express and reflect the **technological system**.
* While **social** and **ideological systems** may condition **technological systems**, they do not determine them.

> Social systems are the functions of technology or philosophy or ideology which express the technological system and reflect the social system.

### Formulas for Social Organization and Property
White developed additional formulas to explain cultural phenomena:
* **Social Organization**:
  **N × P × R = S**
  * **N**: Nutrition
  * **P**: Protection
  * **R**: Reproduction
  * **S**: Social Organization

* **Property**:
  **T × L = P**
  * **T**: Things
  * **L**: Labour
  * **P**: Property

### Definition of Culture
White defined **culture** as:
> An extrasomatic temporal continuum of things and events dependent upon symbolisms.

* **Components**: Tools, implements, utensils, clothing, ornaments, customs, institutions, beliefs, rituals, games, works of art, language, etc.
* This definition aligns with **Tylor’s** concept of culture but emphasizes the **extrasomatic temporal continuum** as a key feature.

### Evolution vs. History
White distinguished between **evolution** and **history**:
* **History**: Focuses on particular, unique events tied to specific times and places.
* **Evolution**: Concerns general classes of things and events, independent of specific times and places.
* **Evolutionary studies** are generalizing, while **historical studies** are particularizing.

> The particular time and particular place are not the temporal sequence of forms counts.

### Universal Evolution
White’s focus on the **general evolution of mankind** led **Julian Steward** to label him a **universal evolutionist**, as he addressed **culture as a whole** rather than specific cultures.

---

## Weaknesses of Leslie A. White’s Evolutionary Scheme

**Leslie A. White** emphasized the dominance of **techno-economic factors** in shaping cultural evolution, proposing that each **techno-economic system**—such as **pastoralism**, **agriculture**, **metallurgy**, and **industry**—directly conditions a specific type of **social organization**. However, this approach has notable limitations:

* **Lack of Ethnographic Support**: White’s assertion of a one-to-one correlation between **techno-economic systems** and **social organization** is not substantiated by **ethnographic evidence**.
* **Example of Agricultural Systems**: **Agricultural systems** exhibit widely divergent forms of **social organization**, contradicting White’s claim of a direct, uniform relationship.

## Julian H. Steward: Contributions to Anthropology

### Background and Early Influences
* **Julian H. Steward** was a student of **A.L. Kroeber** at the **University of California**.
* Contributed data to the **Culture-Element Distribution Study**, reflecting early **particularist influences** from **Kroeber** and **Robert H. Lowie**.
* His initial anthropological work was shaped by these mentors, focusing on detailed cultural specifics.

### Early Fieldwork and Environmental Interests
* Conducted fieldwork in **1927 and 1928** among the **Eastern Mono** and **Paiute** of **Owens Valley, California**.
* This fieldwork solidified his interest in **environmental factors** and their role in shaping cultures.

## Early Theoretical Position
* Up to the publication of *The Economic and Social Basis of Primitive Bands*, Steward aligned with anthropologists who viewed the **natural environment** as a **vaguely limiting or enabling factor** in **culture history**.

### Shift to Cultural Ecology and Multilinear Evolution
* Later in his career, Steward focused on two key concepts:
  * **Cultural Ecology**: Examining the interaction between cultures and their environments.
  * **Multilinear Evolution**: Proposing that cultures evolve along multiple, distinct pathways rather than a single universal sequence.
* These concepts marked a significant departure from his earlier **particularist** perspective.

### Major Publications
* Published his seminal work, *Theory of Culture Change*, in **1955**, which outlined his theories on **cultural ecology** and **multilinear evolution**.
* Contributed numerous **research papers** to reputed anthropological journals, further elaborating his ideas.

## Steward’s Contribution to Evolutionary Theory

### Classification of Evolutionary Approaches
In his influential book, *Theory of Culture Change*, **Julian H. Steward** proposed a three-fold classification of evolutionary approaches to the study of **cultural evolution**:

1. **Unilinear Evolution**
2. **Universal Evolution**
3. **Multilinear Evolution**

**1. Unilinear Evolution**
* Represents the **classical 19th-century evolutionary formulation**.
* Focuses on placing **particular cultures** within a **universal sequence** of developmental stages.

**2. Universal Evolution**
* A modern revision of **unilinear evolution**, emphasizing **culture as a whole** rather than **particular cultures**.
* Concerned with the **evolution of mankind’s culture** globally, excluding **distinctive cultural traditions** and **local variations** as irrelevant.
* Represented by **neo-evolutionists** **Leslie A. White** (America) and **V. Gordon Childe** (Britain), who built on the legacy of **19th-century classical evolutionists**.
* Applicable in its **generalizations** but not in its treatment of **specific particulars**.

**3. Multilinear Evolution**
* Similar to **unilinear evolution** in focusing on **particular cultures**, but distinct in seeking **parallels of limited occurrence** rather than universal patterns.
* Advocated by **Steward**, who identified himself as a **multilinear evolutionist**.
* Rejects the idea that all cultures follow a **single line of development**.
* Generalizations are based on **intensive study of particular cultures**.
* Methodologically **empirical** rather than **deductive**, focusing on **cultural laws** derived from **significant regularities** or **similarities** due to **parallel discoveries**.
* Concerned with **historical reconstructions** but does not classify historical data into **universal stages**.
* Deals with **parallels** or **similarities** that are **limited** in occurrence and **specific** in nature.

> [Steward’s approach] simply seeks cross-cultural regularities and explanations but it presupposes no universal schemes. According to this view, there may be many kinds of evolution and many unlike factors involved.

### Steward’s Focus and Critique
* **Steward** aimed to explain **specific cultural differences** and **similarities**, emphasizing the role of **environmental influences** and **particular cases**.
* He criticized **Leslie White’s** **universal evolution** for its **vague generalizations** and neglect of **environmental factors**.
* In response, **White** argued that **Steward** risked falling into the **historical particularist trap** by overly focusing on **particular cases**.

### Synthesis by Sahlins and Service
**Marshall Sahlins** and **Elman Service**, students and colleagues of both **White** and **Steward**, synthesized their approaches by recognizing two complementary types of evolution:

1. **Specific Evolution**
   * Refers to the **particular sequence of change** and **adaptation** of a **specific society** within a given **environment**.
   * Aligns with **Steward’s multilinear evolution**, emphasizing **cultural diversity** driven by **localized factors** such as **environment** and **invention**.
2. **General Evolution**
   * Describes the **general progress of human society**, where **higher forms** emerge from and surpass **lower forms**.
   * Resembles **White’s universal evolution**, focusing on **larger patterns** that unfold progressively, with **objective measures** as the key criterion.

### Relationship Between Specific and General Evolution
* **Specific evolution** highlights **cultural diversity** shaped by localized factors.
* **General evolution** merges these diversities into **broader patterns** of **progressive development**.

> The keynote of specific evolution is cultural diversity brought about by localized factors such as environment, invention and the like. In general evolutionary perspectives all the diversities become merged into larger patterns that unfold in progressive fashion as objective measure is the key note of general evolution.

### Summary
* **Steward’s multilinear evolution** aligns with **specific evolution**, focusing on **particular cultures** and **empirical parallels**.
* **White’s universal evolution** corresponds to **general evolution**, emphasizing **broad cultural progress**.
* The synthesis by **Sahlins** and **Service** bridges these perspectives, recognizing both **diversity** and **progress** in **cultural evolution**.
