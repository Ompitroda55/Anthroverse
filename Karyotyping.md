# **Karyotyping**

**KARYOTYPING** is a laboratory technique utilized by biological anthropologists for inspecting chromosomes and chromosome sets in human subjects.

### **Key Features of the Technique:**

* Requires only modest laboratory equipment
* Labour-intensive due to cell culture and preparation steps

### **Cell Preparation Process (Sutton, 1980):**

1. **Cell Culture:**
   * Human cells, typically peripheral white blood cells, are cultured for several days in an artificial medium.
   * Cells are held in a stable state of suspended division where chromosomes are most visible.
2. **Hypotonic Treatment:**
   * Cells are placed in a hypotonic solution (lower salt concentration than body fluids).
   * Water moves into the cells, inflating them and spreading out internal structures (including chromosomes).
3. **Slide Preparation:**
   * Cells are transferred to a microscope slide and air-dried.
   * As fluid evaporates, cells flatten and chromosomes spread further apart.
4. **Fixation and Staining:**
   * A fixative and a stain that targets *chromatin* (chromosome material) are applied.
   * Slides are then photographed and images are enlarged.
5. **Karyotype Assembly:**
   * Photos of individual chromosomes are cut out and arranged into categories to form the total human karyotype.

## **Chromosome Banding Techniques**

### **Fluorescent Staining and Q Bands:**

* Several **fluorescent stains** target specific chromosome areas.
* Treated chromosomes exhibit a **fluorescent banding pattern** known as **Q bands**.
* These patterns enable precise chromosome identification.

### **C Banding (Constitutive Heterochromatin):**

* Involves treating chromosomes with **heat, acid, or alkali** to alter or degrade proteins.
* By maintaining treated cells at **37°C** and **neutral pH**, specific regions are stained:
  * Areas alongside **centromeres**
  * **Secondary constrictions** of chromosomes **1, 9, and 16**
  * **Distal long arm** of the chromosome
  * **Satellites** of the **acrocentric chromosomes**
* Resulting stained regions are called **C bands** (C for constitutive heterochromatin).

### **G and R Banding:**

* **Modified Giemsa stain** reveals **G bands**—distinct patterns used for chromosome identification.
* **R banding** is achieved by applying **heat**, reversing G band patterns:
  * **Dark bands** appear where light ones typically would.

## **Applications and Significance**

### **Precision Chromosome Identification:**

* These staining and banding methods allow high-precision identification of:
  * Whole chromosomes
  * Chromosomal segments
* A specialized **nomenclature system** uses banding patterns to designate:
  * Chromosome landmarks
  * Specific regions

### **Research and Evolutionary Insights:**

* **Cytogenetic techniques** derived from these methods are used to:
  * Analyze **chromosomal variation** within and between humans and populations
  * Compare **karyotypes across different species**
* A major focus: determining **evolutionary relationships** among living primates
  * Banding techniques have shown:
    * Close relationships among **chimpanzees**, **gorillas**, and **humans**
    * Greater **phyletic distance** between **orangutans**, **gibbons**, and **humans**
