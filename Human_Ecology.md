# Human Ecology

### **CONCEPT & SCOPE**

* **Living beings**
  All living beings have the **in-built capacity** to adapt themselves to the environment. This is well demonstrated through:

  * **Variation**
  * **Natural selection**

* **Modification of micro-environment by species**
  Many species possess the capability to **amend their micro-environment** for survival. For example:

  * Birds build **nests**.
  * Many mammals create **burrows**.

* **Uniqueness of human beings**
  Human beings are distinct because they can:

  * **Significantly change both their micro-environment and macro-environment**
  * Achieve this transformation through the capacity for what we call **culture**

---

### **ECOLOGY**

* **Definition of Ecology**
  Ecology refers to:
  * The **study of interaction** between living beings and their **natural environment**.
* **Human Ecology**
  * In **Human Ecology**, *Man* is regarded as that living being.
  * There is **no standard definition** of the term *Human Ecology*.
  * As an **interdisciplinary concern**, there is **no unanimity on the scope** of the topic.
* **Adaptability**
  * The **capacity of a species** to change itself to suit the natural environment is called **adaptability**.
  * The term **human adaptability** is also applied to:
    * The **biological responses** which improve any function of an individual or group in a specific environment.
* **Divisions of Human Ecology**
  * For convenience, **Human Ecology** can be divided into:
    * **Cultural**
    * **Biological**

## **CULTURAL ECOLOGY**

* **Origins and Early Development**
  * **Social ecology** found its first adherent in **A. Hawley**, a sociologist who:
    * Coined the term **cultural ecology** in the 1930s.
    * Inferred from studies on **animal ecology and behaviour** (popular even during that period) that such studies could provide valuable insights into the study of **human behaviour**.
* **Julian Steward’s Contribution**
  * In the early 1950s, **Julian Steward** became fully convinced that:
    * The **natural environment** had a strong bearing on the **social and cultural institutions** of all human societies.
  * This led to the development of **Cultural Ecology** through:
    * The amalgamation of his ideas and those of other anthropologists.
  * According to **Baker**:
    > "The emphasis is on the regularities of human behaviour, social structures and values which develop or evolve in response to particular natural environmental niches or situations."
* **Scope of Cultural Ecological Studies**
  * The **majority of cultural ecological studies** focus on:
    * **Pre-literate** and **traditional societies**.
  * Recent trends include:
    * Studying the **effects of variations** in:
      * **Environmental resources**
      * **Population sizes**
      * **External intrusion** by other societies
    * Investigating how these factors influence **cultural evolution**.

---

### **EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY**

* **Introduction**
  * An approach **initiated in the 1970s**.
  * The **individual**, rather than the population, is the **unit of study**.
  * Applies **models previously validated on other animal species** to individual humans.
* **Focus Areas**
  * According to proponents like **Adam Smith**, evolutionary ecology helps clarify human behaviour, including:
    * Why people use specific behaviours for **obtaining food**
    * Why they develop various **mating practices**
    * Why they distribute themselves over space in **different manners**
    * Why they differ in **interrelated characteristics** such as:
      * **Population dynamics**
      * **Community structure**
* **Hypotheses and Emphasis**
  * A number of **hypotheses** have been formulated by **Winterhalder** and other evolutionary ecologists for testing various models.
  * The **major emphasis** has been on:
    * **Behaviour related to the acquisition of food**

## **BIOLOGICAL HUMAN ECOLOGY**

* **Focus of Biological Human Ecology**
  * Unlike the **behavioural interests** of **evolutionary ecologists**, biological human ecology:
    * Stresses the **effects of environments** — both **man-made** and **natural** — on the **biological traits** of human populations.
* **Assumptions and Approaches**
  * There is **no standard set of assumptions or approaches**, as:
    * Biological anthropologists are **not derived from a single scientific stream**.
  * However, one **universally accepted assumption** is:
    > During the course of evolution, **selection resulted in survival and spread of certain traits** which proved essential for the evolution to our own species.
* **Earlier Scientific Perspectives**
  * Before the advent of **biological ecology**:
    * Scientists, including **physiologists** and **epidemiologists**, assumed **causal relationships** for various happenings.
    * These assumptions were considered **universally applicable**, totally ignoring the **impact of diversities in cultures**.
  * While **theoretical postulates** and **traditional definitions of physiology** still have much to contribute:
    * Many other **physiological** and **natural sciences** have **added to the scope** in recent years.
* **Emergence of a Comprehensive Approach**
  * As a consequence, a **more comprehensive approach** has developed for examining how people adapt to their particular environments.
  * This paradigm emphasizes that:
    > A population’s **adaptive response** to an environmental stress is likely to involve several mechanisms, including:
    >
    > * **Learned responses**
    > * **Species-wide physiological adjustment capabilities** (acclimatisation)
    > * **Population-specific genetic characteristics**, which are the result of **natural selection**
    >   (*Baker 1990*)

---

## **HUMAN ADAPTABILITY**

* **Challenges in Developing a Unified Focus**
  * As stated earlier, the **diversity in the background, goals, and approaches** of researchers has been:
    * A major impediment in evolving a **common focus** and **set of theories** in human ecology.
  * However, it is commonly felt that:
    > Ultimately, the **effects of natural and cultural environment** (ignoring chance and supernatural effects) should be the key to the explanation for our **functioning** and **behaviour**.
  * With a **common perspective** and increasing **research data**, it is believed that:
    * **Human ecology** may, in the long run, **evolve into a unified sub-discipline of Anthropology**.

---

* **Shift Towards Human Adaptability**
  * It is now recognized that:
    * The **natural and cultural environment** affects **biological traits** both:
      * **Individually** (e.g. effect of radiation on skin and body)
      * **Specifically** (e.g. resistance to cold)
    * Changes in **culture**, with resulting **stress and strain**, also affect the **human body**.
    * Humans — both **individually** and **collectively** — keep **adapting** to the changing environments.
  * As a result:
    * The field of **human ecology** is now more often referred to as **Human Adaptability**.

---

* **Complexity in Research Design**
  * **Formulating research designs** in the study of human adaptability presents significant challenges because:
    * It requires **at least two individuals or groups** of a society who:
      * Vary only in **one trait under study**.
  * Example:
    * To study the effects of **high altitude hypoxia**, it is necessary to have:
      > Two groups with **identical cultural attributes** and **social preferences**, but differing only in the **altitude of their habitations**.
    * However, obtaining such an **ideal setting** is almost impossible.
    * Furthermore:
      * Humans **cannot** be subjected to **deliberate experimental situations**.
  * Therefore:
    * The conclusions drawn from such studies can, at best, be considered **tentative**.
    * The evolving sub-discipline of **Human Adaptability** must:
      > Create means to **identify the quantum of variations** in inferences caused by the inherent difficulties in approaching the **near-ideal situations**.

---

## **TOLERANCE TO NATURAL STRESSES**

* **Science and Survival in Diverse Environments**
  * Today, **science** has developed certain **methods and resources** through which:
    * **Living beings** can live almost **anywhere** for varying durations of time.
  * However, all living beings:
    * Are made up of **living cells**.
    * Depend on the **potential of these cells** to cope with **stress** for survival.

* **Nature’s Stress Factors**
  * **Nature exerts stress** through:
    * **Temperature**
    * **Pressure**
    * **Radiation**
    * **Nutrition**, etc.
  * The majority of living species:
    * Have **adapted themselves** for living in certain **specific econiches**.

---

* **Adaptations Among Mammals and Primates**
  * Many **mammals** today have:
    * **Evolved** in such a way that they can **adapt** to various **terrestrial environments**.
  * Early **primates**:
    * Developed in **specific ecological niches**.
    * Did **not** develop adaptations to live in **all types of environments**.
* **Role of Homo Erectus**
  * It was probably **Homo erectus** who:
    * Through knowledge of the **uses of fire**, could enter the:
      > Erstwhile hostile **extremely cold climates** of the world.

---

* **General Conditions of Human Evolution**
  * It is generally believed that:
    > Most of the **human evolution** took place in areas which were:
    >
    > * **Hot during the day**
    > * With **comparative cooler nights**
    > * **High solar radiation**
    > * **Comparatively low humidity**
    > * **Relatively high atmospheric pressure**

---

## **ADAPTATION TO HEAT**

#### **Homeostatic System and Body Temperature**

* A **homeostatic system** tries to maintain an almost constant temperature.
* The **human body** tends to maintain its temperature at about **37°C**, at which it functions efficiently.
* This **normal temperature** fluctuates due to:
  * Age
  * Sex
  * Nature of physical activity
  * Weather
  * Time of the day
* Example:
  > Young adults at rest (with only basic metabolic activities) may have a body temperature of about **30°C** provided there is minimal heat loss (such as in cold weather).

---

#### **Impact of Rising Body Temperature**

* A rise in body temperature generally implies **activity**.
* A rise of **4-5°C** above normal can cause:
  * Permanent damage to body systems
  * Death
* Body temperature can return to normal through:
  * Continual heat loss to surroundings
  * This is only possible if the **surrounding temperature** is lower than body temperature.

---

#### **Mechanisms of Heat Loss**

According to **Baker (1990)**, heat loss occurs through:

* **Sweating**
  * Humans have over **a million sweat glands**, with minor variations among populations.
  * Sweat glands are activated during childhood.
  * If a child experiences **acute heat stress**, most of their sweat glands become activated, leading to better **heat tolerance** in adulthood.
  * Thus, heat tolerance in adults is a function of **heat stress faced during childhood**.
* **Sweating and Acclimatization**
  * The capacity to sweat varies with **acclimatization**.
  * In an **extreme hot desert**:
    * A young male may excrete up to **4 liters/hour** initially.
    * This gradually stabilizes to about **2 liters/hour**.
    * An individual living there for a longer period may excrete on average **8 liters/day**.
  * Sweating depends on:
    * Body temperature vs. external temperature
    * **Radiation load**
    * **Relative humidity**
  * Conditions:
    * In **hot desert and savanna**, sweat evaporates quickly.
    * In **hot humid conditions** (e.g., coal mines, sea-shores), sweat evaporation is hampered, affecting sweat glands' function.
  * **Body fat content** also influences sweat rate.

---

#### **Radiation Load, Temperature, and Humidity**

* **Baker (1955)** reported on the relationship between:
  * **Radiation load**
  * **Temperature**
  * **Relative humidity**
> (See figure in original source)

---

#### **Variations in Heat Tolerance**

* Heat tolerance varies with:
  * **Age**
  * **Sex**
  * **Shape**
  * **Size**
  * **Body composition**
* **Infants and Newborns**:
  * Limited development of sweat glands and neurological apparatus → low heat tolerance.
  * Higher surface area relative to body mass → quicker increase in body temperature with higher air temperature or radiation load.
  * **Little (1973)** concludes:
    > “Higher air temperatures as also high radiation load may be important factors in high infant mortality.”

* **Surface Area to Body Mass Ratio (SA/BM)**:
  * Infants: about **0.6 cm²/gm**
  * Adults: about **0.03 cm²/gm**
  * Taller people: even lower ratio
  * Longer limbs: slightly higher SA/BM ratio

---

#### **Heat Tolerance in Adults**

* Adults have **low surface area** relative to body mass → **higher heat tolerance**.
* **Subcutaneous fat** affects heat tolerance.
* Study during **Second World War** on American soldiers:
  > “Men 10 percent above average weight for height had death rates nine times those of men 10 percent below average weight (for height).”

---

#### **Effect of Humidity**

* In **high relative humidity** areas:
  * Sweat evaporation is slow.
  * This negatively affects **heat tolerance**.

---

#### **Population Differences and Acclimatization**

* Population differences exist due to:
  * Natural environments
  * Working conditions
* With increasing **acclimatization**, individual differences in heat tolerance tend to merge.

---

## **ADAPTATION TO COLD**

#### **General Characteristics of Human Cold Tolerance**

* Humans possess a **large body mass compared to surface area**.
* Despite adaptations to colder environments, humans still retain legacies of their **tropical origins**.
* **Cold tolerance** in humans is much lower than in **arctic animals**, partly because:
  * Arctic animals have a thick coat of fur or hair.
  * Humans lack such insulating mechanisms except for a layer of **subcutaneous fat**.

---

#### **Heat Loss and Initial Body Response**

* With atmospheric temperature below **28°C**, persistent **body heat loss** to surroundings begins.
* According to **Baker (1990)**:
  > “When air temperatures fall below 28°C the arterials below our subcutaneous fat vasoconstrict. The warmed blood from the core of the body is then shunted away from the skin and, as the skin temperature declines, the loss of heat from the core of the body is reduced.”
* Effects based on individual characteristics:
  * **Inactive individuals with heavy subcutaneous fat**: Vasoconstriction keeps core temperature neutral even at **15°C**.
  * **Thin individuals**: May trigger further homeostatic responses (e.g. shivering) by **25°C**.
* Behavioral responses:
  * Huddling (reduces surface area for heat loss)
  * Voluntary muscular activity (increases heat production)

---

#### **Shivering and Voluntary Activity**

* In **inactive individuals**:
  * **Involuntary muscle contraction** (visible shivering) starts as core temperature falls.
  * Shivering can raise **metabolic level** up to **100% above basal**.
* **Voluntary activity**:
  * Activities like running can generate even greater heat.
  * Sustaining such high metabolic output over long periods is limited.

---

#### **Role of Subcutaneous Fat**

* **Subcutaneous fat** significantly contributes to **cold tolerance**.
* Typical effects of temperature drop:
  * **3–4°C dip** → loss of mental alertness.
  * Further **3–4°C dip** → unconsciousness, though often without permanent tissue damage.
* Individuals with significant subcutaneous fat may remain unaffected under such conditions.
* **Normal fit young adults**:
  * Can survive for hours at low temperatures (with low wind speed) through **physical exercise** generating heat.

---

#### **Comparative Cold and Heat Tolerance**

* **Tolerance to cold** is generally:
  * Much **less** than tolerance to heat.
  * Much more **varied** among populations.
* Early hominids and present-day **hunter-gatherers** used:
  * **Fire** to survive cold (even without clothing).
* **Clothing** has significantly enhanced human ability to withstand temperatures well below freezing.

---

#### **Influence of Age and Sex**

* **Hanna (1976)**:
  > Through studies of highland **Quechua Indians** of Peru, demonstrated that children have the least tolerance to cold due to early-age disadvantages in skin-fold thickness and underdeveloped neurological systems.
* Consequences for children:
  * Rapid fall in **core body temperature** during early sleep.
  * Core temperature remains fairly constant under **basal metabolism**.
* **Body weight and composition**:
  * Heavier individuals (same height) tolerate colder environments better due to insulation from subcutaneous fat.
* **Women**:
  * Generally shorter, with shorter limbs → less surface area per unit body mass → expected higher core temperature.
  * However, in **cold-exercise experiments**, sex differences in cold tolerance are not significant.

---

#### **Population Differences in Cold Tolerance**

* Studies on genetically different populations:
  * **No significant population differences** found:
    * Lampietro et al (1959): US Blacks vs. US Whites
    * Elsner et al (1960): Canadian Indians vs. Whites
  * **Significant differences in mean skin temperatures** found:
    * Scholar et al (1958): Native Australians vs. Whites
    * Hart et al (1962): Inuit vs. Whites
    * Anderson et al (1960): Lapps vs. Whites
    * Baker et al (1966): Quechua vs. Whites
  > In general, **Whites exhibited lower skin temperatures**.

* **Hammel (1964)**:

  > Suggested that as human evolution occurred in tropical arid regions, populations living in tropical savannas might have had a **genetic adaptation** to cold sleeping conditions, which could have been lost in populations native to other environments.

---

## **ADAPTATION TO ALTITUDE**

---

#### **Relationship Between Altitude and Atmospheric Conditions**

* There exists an **inverse relationship** between:
  * **Density of air** and **atmospheric pressure**
  * **Altitude**
* This relationship is evident when travelling by plane:
  * Flight captains announce both the flying altitude and atmospheric conditions.

---

#### **Physiological Stress at High Altitude**

* At **high altitude** (2500 m or \~8000 ft and above sea level):
  * The primary stress factor is **hypoxia**—a significant reduction in **partial pressure of oxygen**.
  * As a result, the amount of **oxygen available per unit of air** for vital body systems is greatly reduced, causing considerable **physiological stress**.

---

#### **Initial Human Response to High Altitude**

* **Little & Morren (1979)** findings:
  > “Hypoxic conditions start affecting at about 2000 m above sea level, and at 4000 m the amount of oxygen available to blood is significantly low.”
* For low-altitude individuals visiting high altitude:
  * Immediate increase in **breathing rate** and **heart rate**
  * These responses help draw more oxygen from the environment.
  * After several days, individuals **acclimatize** and body functions stabilize.

---

#### **Studies on Oxygen Consumption at High Altitude**

* Numerous studies, especially under the **International Biological Programme**, have examined high altitude hypoxia.
* Key findings:
  * **Low-altitude natives migrating to high altitudes** adapt by reducing oxygen consumption.
  * Examples of observed reductions:
    * **Baker (1969)**:
      * US Whites: **24.4%** decrease
      * Quechua Indians: **9.7%** decrease
    * **Velasquez (1964)**: Peruvian sailors—**19.5%** decrease
    * **Pugh (1958)**: English mountain climbers—**20.6%** decrease
    * **Reeves et al (1967)**: US White athletes—**25.1%** decrease
    * **Buskirk et al (1967)**: US White athletes—**27.2%** decrease
* Implications:
  * Decreased **oxygen consumption capacity** affects **work capacity**.
  * Short stays (up to **1 year**) show no significant improvement in work capacity.
  * **Longer stays** (over **5 years**) lead to noteworthy improvement.
  * Upon returning to low altitude, migrants’ **oxygen consumption capacity rises**.
* **High-altitude natives**:
  * Do not show this increase in oxygen consumption after returning to lower altitudes.
  * Studies on these populations show **inconsistent conclusions**.

---

#### **Growth Patterns at High Altitude**

* **Man in the Andes project**:
  * High-altitude **South American Andean children** exhibit low physical growth rates, especially during **infancy** and **adolescence**.
* Regional findings:
  * **Tien Shan mountains (CIS)**: Similar results as the Andes.
  * **Sherpa of Nepal (Pawson, 1974)**: No significant difference in physical growth compared to low-altitude counterparts.
  * **Ethiopian highlanders**: Faster growth rate than lowlanders.
* No studies have conclusively specified reasons for these variations:
  * Possible **overestimation of altitude effects** at the expense of **other environmental** and **genetic factors**.

---

#### **Conclusion**

> **Baker (1990)**:
> “The high-altitude populations of the world appear well adapted to their environment in spite of the fact that temporary sojourners suffer a variety of symptoms and perhaps a permanent reduction in work capacity. While a short-term acclimatizational process contributes to native abilities, it appears that either developmental change or genetic adaptation is necessary for people to become fully functional at the higher elevations. As the graph developed by Buskirk (1978) suggests, most of the people reaching the top of Mount Everest (Sagarmāthā) are likely in the near future to be native residents of high-altitude regions of the world.”

## **ADAPTATION TO NUTRITIONAL STRESS**

#### **Classification of Animal Diets**

* Animals can be classified based on diet as:
  * **Herbivores** (including **fructivores**)
  * **Carnivores**
  * **Omnivores**
* Key points:
  * Animals **cannot convert radiant energy** into useful forms (unlike plants).
  * **Herbivores**:
    * Advantage: Greater mass of **convertible energy** available due to plant biomass.
  * **Specific carnivores**:
    * Have access to much less convertible energy.
  * **General carnivores**:
    * Advantage over herbivores tied to specific plants/econiches.
    * Access to larger biomass → more energy available for survival.

---

#### **Position of Omnivores**

* While **omnivores** (e.g., humans) can benefit from both plant and animal sources:
  * They **do not necessarily have a considerable advantage**.
  * Reason: Humans can only use part of available energy, and only in forms of:
    * **Proteins**
    * **Lipids**
    * **Carbohydrates**

---

#### **Basal Metabolism and Energy Needs**

* **Basal metabolism**:
  * Energy required at complete rest for vital organ function.
  * Varies with physiological conditions:
    * **Higher during growth**
    * **Higher in pregnancy**
    * **Higher in lactation**
* Basal metabolic energy requirements:
  * **Young children**: \~36 kcal/hr
  * **Average adult male**: \~78 kcal/hr
  * **Lactating mothers**: \~95 kcal/hr
  * Daily basal range: **800 kcal/day to 2,300 kcal/day**
* Influencing factors:
  * **Hot or cold stress** → energy loss → increased requirements

---

#### **Energy Requirements During Activity**

* Energy needs rise considerably during activity.
* **Leslie et al** calculations of energy cost above BMR:

| **LEVEL**     | **Cost above BMR (kcal/kg/hr)** | **Example of Activity** |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1. Resting    | 0.00                            | Lying still             |
| 2. Sitting 1  | 0.25                            | Sitting quietly         |
| 3. Standing 1 | 0.50                            | Standing ‘at ease’      |
| 4. Sitting 2  | 1.00                            | Sewing, weaving         |
| 5. Standing 2 | 1.50                            | Sweeping                |
| 6. Walking 1  | 2.50                            | 4.8 km/hr, no load      |
| 7. Walking 2  | 3.50                            | 4.8 km/hr, 15 kg load   |
| 8. Heavy      | 4.50                            | Hoeing, ploughing       |
| 9. Very heavy | 7.00                            | Tree felling            |
| 10. Extreme   | 10.00                           | Near maximum exertion   |

* **Conclusion from table**:
  * Total daily energy needs may **double basal level** depending on activity.

---

#### **Nutrient Energy Values**

* **Protein**: 4.06 kcal/gm (effective)
* **Carbohydrates**: 4.06 kcal/gm
* **Lipids**: 9.06 kcal/gm

---

#### **Variation in Energy Needs Across Populations**

* Factors:
  * Different environments
  * Demographic structure
  * Adult body size
* Estimates:
  * **UN/FAO** estimates (based on US and Britain populations) overestimate requirements for smaller-bodied populations elsewhere.
  * **Leslie et al** provided revised, more representative estimates.

---

#### **Nutritional Adaptation in Populations**

* **Prior et al (1981)** findings:
  * **Inuit Eskimo**: High energy from animal fats
  * **Polynesians**: High energy from coconut vegetable fats
  * **Vegetarians**: Low protein intake
  * **Meat-eaters**: Protein-rich diets
  * **New Guinea populations**: Survive on diets with merely **4% protein content**

### **Nutritional Patterns of Various Populations**

#### **Hunters and Food-Gatherers**

* **Hunters and food-gatherers** are known to have fairly nutritious diets.

* **Lee (1979)** reported on the **!Kung** diet:

  * Meat: \~⅓ of total food
  * Mongo nuts: >25%
  * Other vegetables: >40%
  * Caloric intake: \~2,350 kcal/day (recorded July–August 1964, prior to Western cultural influence)
  * Result: Quite a balanced diet

* **Scholars (1955)** documented the **Inuit Eskimo** diet (mid-1850s):

  * \~3,375 kcal/person/day (about 15% higher than Oxford Standards)
  * High in fat-soluble vitamins
  * Lacking in fibres

> *"There is a good reason to conclude that other hunter-food gatherers too must be consuming fairly balanced diets comprising of about two dozen or more varieties of eatables."*

---

#### **Pastoralists and Agriculturists**

* Developed **adaptive strategies** based on:

  * Local nutritional requirements
  * Locally available nutrition

* Strategies included:

  * Domestication of animals for **animal protein**
  * Adaptation to available nutrition

* However, **natural selection pressures**:

  * Spread of disease
  * Natural calamities
  * These often disturbed population balance regarding survival capabilities

---

### **Role of Nutrients in Human Diet**

#### **Proteins**

* Fulfill vital need for **nitrogenous products** (cannot be produced without dietary nitrogen).
* Low protein intake:

  * Can lead to **stunted growth**
  * May cause **Kwashiorkor**, **marasmus** (with mental slowness, physical lassitude, and other symptoms)

#### **Lipids (Fats)**

* Provide highest energy among nutrients.
* **Essential fatty acids** (unsaturated fats) must be consumed.
* Other fats can be produced within the body by converting carbohydrates into lipids.

#### **Carbohydrates**

* Largest component of nutrition in all human populations.
* Essential for **instant energy requirements** of the body.

---

#### **Water**

* Functions:

  * Acts as a cooling agent
  * Transports nutrients
* Impact of dehydration:

  * Small dehydration → severe brain activity impairment
  * 5% dehydration → may result in death
* Special conditions:

  * **Children**: Prone to severe diarrhoea
  * **Desert populations**: Adapted to low water intake, but kidney stones more common due to shortage

---

#### **Salts**

* Salts are regularly excreted through urine and sweat → **regular intake is essential**.

* **Common salt (sodium chloride)**:

  * Required continually

* **Calcium**:

  * Most important salt after sodium chloride
  * Population adaptations:

    * **Meso-America**: Maize soaked in lime water for cooking
    * **South America**: Burnt limestone added to children's food
  * Calcium deficiency: Rarely found

* **Iron**:

  * Essential due to regular loss of **RBCs** (especially in women during menstruation and pregnancy)
  * Sources:

    * Animal foods, blood-rich organs (e.g. liver, heart)
  * Deficiency:

    * Common in grain-based diets → anemia
  * Caution:

    * Excess iron → cirrhosis of liver, early death (e.g. Inuit Eskimo with high meat diets)

* **Iodine**:

  * Deficiency causes **goitre** (thyroid gland enlargement)
  * Maternal deficiency → passed to newborns
  * Historical prevalence:

    * Widespread in the 19th century
  * Solution:

    * Simple dietary modification (e.g. **iodized salt**) → most regions now iodine-deficiency free

#### **Vitamins**

* Both **fat-soluble** and **water-soluble vitamins** are essential nutritional components.
* Extensively discussed in everyday science texts.

## **Bergman’s Rule and Allen’s Rule**

### **Bergman’s Rule**

* **C. Bergman (1847)** attempted to correlate **climatic conditions** and **body size**.
* Formulated **Bergman’s Rule**:
  > *“Within a polytypic warm-blooded species, the body size of the sub-type usually increases with decreasing mean temperature of its habitat.”*
* **Evidence supporting Bergman’s Rule**:
  * **D.F. Roberts**:
    * Studied 116 samples from different indigenous populations.
    * Found coefficient of correlation (**r**) ≈ 0.6.
    * Included both **height** and **weight** and applied **multivariate analysis**:
      * **r ≈ 0.82** for men
      * **r ≈ 0.704** for women
  * By subdividing male samples according to their **geographic distribution**, Roberts produced a graph illustrating these patterns.
  * **Newman (1953)**, using a larger number of populations, reached similar conclusions.
* **Key observations from the graph**:
  * Populations without a known history of migration show a **steeper regression** than those who migrated to their habitats only a few thousand years ago (e.g. **Amerindians**, **Southeast Asian Mongoloids**).
  * Roberts attributed greater variations **more to genetic factors** than nutritional factors.
  * Newman also emphasized **genetic factors** as more important.
> *“Through Roberts’ graph, Bergman’s Rule is validated for human populations as well.”*

### **Allen’s Rule**

* **Allen (1877)** proposed Allen’s Rule for polytypic warm-blooded species:
  > *“The relative size of exposed portions of the body decreases with the decrease of mean temperature.”*
* **Roberts’ examination of Allen’s Rule in humans**:
  * Relied on:
    * **Relative sitting height vertex** (sitting height as a proportion of total height)
    * **Span** (largest distance between fingertips of two hands when arms are fully stretched in opposite directions)
* **Findings**:
  * Roberts’ observations (1978) showed a similar correlation as with Bergman’s Rule.
  * Validated the application of **Allen’s Rule** to human populations.
  * Populations living in **hotter climates** exhibited **higher relative sitting height vertex**.
* **Note on secular trends**:
  * The **secular trend of increased height** in recent decades may modify some of Roberts’ conclusions.

## **Allen’s Rule: Shape-Shifting to Beat Climate Change**

#### **1. Allen’s Rule: Historical Context**

* In the **1870s**, American zoologist **Joel Allen** observed that:
  > *“Warm-blooded animals in colder climates had smaller appendages than those in warmer parts.”*
* This observation came to be known as **Allen’s Rule**.
* Examples:
  * **Elephants** cool themselves using **ear flaps**.
  * **Birds** regulate heat through their **bills**.

---

#### **2. Climate Change and Urgency**

* An **August 2021 report** by the **Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)** warned:
  > *“We have very little time to avert catastrophic global warming.”*
* This highlights the need to:
  * Predict how **wildlife will respond** to climate change.
  * Identify which **species are most vulnerable** and prioritize them for **conservation**.

---

#### **3. Animal Adaptations: Shapeshifting Trends**

* Research by **Deakin University** examined how animals are **modifying body parts**—such as **ears**, **tails**, **beaks**, and **legs**—to cope with **rising temperatures**.
* Findings:
  * The phenomenon is **widespread**.
  * It suggests that **climate warming may result in fundamental changes to animal form**.
  * While some animals are **adapting**, many **will not** survive these rapid changes.

---

#### **4. Examples of Appendage Changes**

* **Mammals’ Appendage Growth**:
  * **Masked shrew**:
    * **Tail and leg length** have increased significantly since **1950**.
  * **Great roundleaf bat**:
    * **Wing size** increased by **1.64%** over the same period.

---

#### **5. Appendages and Multifunctionality**

* Animal appendages are not just for temperature regulation.
* Example:
  * **Galapagos medium ground finch**:
    * **Average beak size** changed over time in response to **seed size**, which is influenced by **rainfall**.
    * After **drier summers**, **small-beaked birds** had reduced survival rates.
    * Research concluded:
      > *“Birds with smaller beaks were less likely to survive.”*

---

#### **6. Broader Implications**

* **Biological patterns** like **Allen’s Rule** are valuable for:
  * Making **predictions** about **evolutionary changes** in animals as the **climate warms**.
* Despite ongoing adaptations:
  * The **best way to avert disaster** remains the **reduction of greenhouse gas emissions**.
