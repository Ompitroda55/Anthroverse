# Structural Functionalism: A. R. Radcliffe-Brown’s Theory

### Background and Fieldwork
- **A. R. Radcliffe-Brown (1881–1955)** was a student of **W.H.R. Rivers** at Cambridge.
- Conducted fieldwork:
  - Among the **Andamanese** from 1906 to 1908.
  - Among the **Australian Aborigines** from 1910 to 1912.

### Core Concept of Functionalism
- Radcliffe-Brown based his theory of human behavior on **functionalism**.
- Unlike **Malinowski**, who focused on satisfying individual needs, Radcliffe-Brown emphasized that social behaviors maintain a society’s **social structure**.
- Definition of **social structure**:
  > The Social structure of a society is the total network of its existing social relationships.  
  > — Radcliffe-Brown, *Structure and Function in Primitive Society*

### Definition and Study of Social Structure
- A pragmatic definition from research by Radcliffe-Brown and his students:
  > The study of groups, specially those organized along territorial, kinship and political lines and interrelationships among these constitute the core of social structural phenomena.  
  > — **Marvin Harris**
- **Functions** are defined as the “contribution” an institution makes to the maintenance of **social structure**.

### Three Aspects of the Social System
- Radcliffe-Brown identified three heuristically separable “adaptational” aspects of the total **social system**:
  1. **Social Structure**: The arrangements by which an orderly social life is maintained.
  2. **Ecological**: The way the system is adapted to the physical environment.
  3. **Cultural**: The mechanisms by which an individual acquires “habits and mental characteristics that fit him for participation in social life.”
- Comparison by **Marvin Harris**:
  > This division of social system into three aspects is like “the familiar Marxist three-part division of socio-cultural systems into socio-structural, techno-economic and ideological phenomena.”
- Harris emphasizes the separability of **social structure** from the **techno-environmental** and **techno-economic** complex.

### Primacy of Social Structure
- Among the three aspects, Radcliffe-Brown prioritized the analysis of **social structure**.
- Economic systems are understood in relation to **social structure**:
  > The Economic Machinery of a society appears in quite a new light if it is studied in relation to the social structure. The exchange of goods and services is dependent upon, is the result of, and at the same time is a means of maintaining a certain structure, a network of relations between persons and collections of persons.  
  > — Radcliffe-Brown
- Example of the **Potlatch** among the Indians of northwest America:
  - Economists and politicians viewed it as “wasteful foolishness” and banned it.
  - Anthropologists saw it as:
    > The machinery for maintaining a social structure of lineages, clans and moieties, with which was combined the arrangement of rank defined by privileges.  
    > — Radcliffe-Brown

## Theory of Structural Functionalism

### Influence of Emile Durkheim
- **A. R. Radcliffe-Brown** was strongly influenced by **Emile Durkheim (1858–1917)**, a prominent French sociologist.
- Durkheim’s key ideas:
  - Society is an **integrated system** of interrelated parts.
  - **Culture** is a product of a community, not of single individuals.
  - The ultimate reality of human life is **sociological**, not psychological.
  - This sociological reality, termed **“Collective Consciousness”**, exists beyond the individual:
    > [It] consists of the social products of people interacting in groups over generations.  
    > — Durkheim
  - Individual actions and beliefs are manifestations of this larger **sociological reality**.

### Radcliffe-Brown’s Structural Functionalism
- Radcliffe-Brown likened society to an **organism**, an integrated whole dependent on the proper functioning of its constituent parts.
- Society has a **“life of its own”**, obeying laws that transcend the individual.
- His mission:
  > To investigate the anatomy of society and document the dynamics of its components.  
  > — Radcliffe-Brown
- Unlike **Malinowski**’s functionalism, which focused on how culture sustains individuals, Radcliffe-Brown’s **structural functionalism** emphasized:
  - How elements of **social structure** (e.g., major groups and institutions) function to maintain **social order** and **equilibrium**.

## **Assumptions of Structural Functionalism**

### Key Assumptions
- **Core Principle**: **Structural-functionalists** assume that **social systems** maintain themselves in a **steady state** for significant periods, characterized by:
  - High degree of **cohesion** and **solidarity** among members.
- Influenced by **Emile Durkheim**’s approach to **social phenomena**, emphasizing **solidarity**.
  - Radcliffe-Brown substitutes Durkheim’s term “**Solidarity**” with:
    - **Unity**
    - **Harmony**
    - **Consistency**

### Functional Unity
- A **social system** is defined as:
  > The total **social structure** of a society together with the totality of said usages in which that structure appears and on which it depends for its continued existence.  
  > — Radcliffe-Brown
- This system exhibits **functional unity**, described as:
  > A condition in which all parts of the **social system** work together with a sufficient degree of **harmony** or **internal consistency**, i.e., without producing persistent conflicts which can neither be resolved nor regulated.  
  > — Radcliffe-Brown

## Explanations of Structural Functionalism: Radcliffe-Brown’s Synchronic Approach

### Synchronic Methodology
- **A. R. Radcliffe-Brown** provided **synchronic** explanations of **social phenomena**, focusing on a static study at a specific point in time.
  - Contrasts with **diachronic** studies, which analyze phenomena across time periods.
- His approach avoids historical or evolutionary perspectives, emphasizing current **social structure** dynamics.

### Case Study: Asymmetrical Joking Relationship Among the Bathonga
- **Context**: Radcliffe-Brown studied the relationship between the **mother’s brother** and **sister’s son** among the **Bathonga** of East Africa.
- **Description of Relationship**:
  - An **asymmetrical joking relationship** where the sister’s son:
    - Enters the uncle’s house in his absence.
    - Steals his favorite spear.
    - Engages in lewd conversation with the uncle’s wife.
    - Demands to be fed.
    - Behaves disrespectfully.
  - Custom requires the uncle (**malume**, meaning “male mother”) to not retaliate.
  - In contrast, custom demands great respect toward the **father’s brother**.
- **Junod’s Explanation**:
  - From an **evolutionary perspective**, suggesting the Bathonga passed through a **matriarchal phase**.
- **Radcliffe-Brown’s Synchronic Explanation**:
  - Among the **patrilineal Bathonga**:
    - The **father** is a stern patriarch, as are his brothers and sisters.
    - The **mother** is warm and indulgent, as are her brothers and sisters.
    - Greatest familiarity occurs between people of the same sex.
  - Thus:
    - The **mother’s brother** (**malume**) is indulgent, like the mother.
    - The **father’s sister** (**nananc**, meaning “female father”) is aloof, like the father.
  - **Structural Functional Significance**:
    > The Bathonga joking relationship contributes to the maintenance of the **patrilineage**.  
    > — Radcliffe-Brown

### Managing In-Law Tensions
- **Context**: Radcliffe-Brown analyzed how societies address tensions among people related through marriage.
- **Strategies to Reduce Tensions**:
  1. **Avoidance**:
     - Strict rules prevent face-to-face interaction (e.g., **Navaho** men avoid their **mother-in-law**).
     - Likely between in-laws of **different generations**.
  2. **Disrespectful Teasing**:
     - Mutual disrespect or teasing is permitted.
     - Likely between in-laws of the **same generation**.
- **Purpose**:
  > Both **avoidance** and **teasing** are ways to avoid real conflict and help in maintaining the **social structure**.  
  > — Radcliffe-Brown
- **Example**:
  - American **mother-in-law jokes** may serve a similar function by relieving tensions.

## Socio-Cultural Laws in Structural Functionalism

### Radcliffe-Brown’s Belief in Socio-Cultural Laws
- **A. R. Radcliffe-Brown** argued that focusing on **social structure** enables the discovery of **socio-cultural laws**.
- He contrasted **social anthropology** with **ethnology**:
  > Ethnology with its strictly historical method can only tell us that certain things have happened, or have probably or possibly happened, social anthropology with its inductive generalization can tell us how and why things happen, i.e. according to what laws.  
  > — Radcliffe-Brown

### Opposition to Boasian Viewpoint
- Radcliffe-Brown opposed the **Boasian viewpoint** that no **socio-cultural laws** can be found.
- He criticized the Boasian perspective:
  > I sort of evidence (rational or empirical) they would base their contention. Generalizations about any sort of subject matter are of two kinds—the generalizations of common opinion, and generalizations that have been verified or demonstrated by a systematic examination of evidence afforded by precise observations systematically made. Generalizations of the latter kind are called scientific laws—those who hold that there are no generalizations about human society because they themselves hold such generalizations and even make new ones of their ‘own’.  
  > — Radcliffe-Brown
- He argued that **scientific laws** arise from systematic, evidence-based generalizations, unlike common opinion.

### Principles of Classificatory Kinship Terminology
- Radcliffe-Brown identified three principles to analyze **Classificatory Kinship Terminology** and **Social Structure**:
  1. **Unity of the Sibling Group**:
     - Brothers and sisters share a feeling of **solidarity** and are treated as a unit by outsiders.
     - Example: The **mother’s sister** is also addressed as **mother**.
  2. **Unity of the Lineage Group**:
     - **Lineage members** exhibit **solidarity** and are treated as a single unit by outsiders.
  3. **Generation Principle**:
     - There is **distance or tension** between members of succeeding generations.
     - Members of **alternating generations** tend to share **easy and friendly relationships**.

### Sociological Laws
- Radcliffe-Brown proposed **sociological laws** as universal conditions necessary for a **social system**’s continued existence:
  1. **Functional Consistency**:
     > One such law or necessary conditions of continued existence is that of a Certain degree of **functional consistency** amongst the constituent parts of the **social system**.  
     > — Radcliffe-Brown
  2. **Resolution of Conflicts**:
     > Rights and duties need to be defined in such a way that conflict of law is the resolution is resolved without destroying the **structure**.  
     > — Radcliffe-Brown
  3. **Stability and Definiteness**:
     - A **social system** requires **consistency**, **stability**, and **definiteness** to maintain its structure.

## Criticism of Structural Functionalism

### Weakness of Socio-Cultural Laws
- The **socio-cultural laws** proposed by **A. R. Radcliffe-Brown** are criticized for not being true laws in the conventional sense:
  - They provide only **interpretations** of observed **social phenomena**, lacking the ability to **explain** or **predict**.
  - **Marvin Harris** critiques:
    > The tragedy of Radcliffe Brown’s contribution to theory is that the ‘laws’ which he produced were distinguished by their **weakness**, their low capacity for **prediction** and **retrodiction**, and their **vapidity**.  
    > — Harris

### Radcliffe-Brown’s Acknowledgment of Limitations
- Radcliffe-Brown recognized the limitations of his **laws**:
  - In his 1935 paper on **Patrilineal and Matrilineal Succession**:
    > It might be expected that such a paper as this would deal with the question of what factors determine the selection by some people of the **matrilineal** and by others of the **patrilineal** principle in determining status or succession. My opinion is that our knowledge and understanding are not sufficient to permit us to deal with this problem in any satisfactory manner.  
    > — Radcliffe-Brown
  - In 1941, regarding **kinship terminology**:
    > If you ask the question, how is it that **Omaha** (or any tribe we have considered) have the system they do?, then it is obvious that the method of **structural analysis** does not afford an answer.  
    > — Radcliffe-Brown
- These admissions highlight that **structural functionalism**’s laws failed to address fundamental questions.

### Reasons for Weakness According to Marvin Harris
- **Marvin Harris** identifies two primary reasons for the inadequacy of **structural functionalism**’s laws:
  1. **Neglect of Techno-Economic Parameters**:
     - **Techno-economic parameters** are not sufficiently considered in **structural functionalism**.
     - Harris argues that a **science of culture** is impossible without prioritizing these parameters over **social structure**.
  2. **Lack of Diachronic Inquiry**:
     - Until the 1950s, **structural functionalism** did not incorporate **diachronic** (historical) inquiry.
     - Available **historical sources**, which were abundant and reputable, were not utilized.

## Functionalism in General: Limitations and Critiques

### Common Limitations of Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown’s Functionalism
- **Malinowski**’s **functionalism**:
  - Focuses on how **social phenomena** satisfy **individual needs**.
- **Radcliffe-Brown**’s **functionalism**:
  - Explains how **social phenomena** contribute to **functional unity**.
- Shared Assumption:
  - Both view societies as **well-oiled machines**, with parts working **harmoniously**.
- Critique:
  - This view may be overly simplistic, as some traits may be:
    - **Neutral** in terms of system maintenance.
    - **Detrimental** to society.

### Merton’s Critique of Early Functionalist Assumptions
- **Robert Merton** challenges assumptions made by early **functionalists**:
  - They assumed **integration** of the **social system** as a given.
    - Merton argues that **integration** must be **empirically determined** and **measured**.
  - They assumed every **social item** makes **positive contributions** to **social system** integration.
    - Merton contends that some items can have **negative consequences**.
  - Source: Turner, *The Structure of Sociological Theory*.

### Neglect of Historical Factors
- Both **Malinowski** and **Radcliffe-Brown** were **present-oriented**:
  - Focused solely on the current role of a **trait**.
  - Ignored how traits **came about** historically.

### Failure to Explain Cultural Variation
- The **theoretical orientation** of **functionalism** struggles to account for **cultural variation**:
  - Why are **individual needs** satisfied in one specific way and not another?
  - Why is **social structure** maintained by one **custom** and not another?
- **Marvin Harris** suggests:
  - Answers may require consideration of **technological**, **economic**, and **ecological factors**.
  - **Functionalists** did not pursue this line of inquiry.
