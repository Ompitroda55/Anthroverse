## **PURUSARTHAS**

### 1. **Introduction: Hindu Philosophy and the Goal of Life**

* It is often believed that **Hindus** focus more on the afterlife than on worldly life.
* While the **end goal** is liberation (*moksa*) from the cycle of births and deaths, Hindu sages:
  * **Recognize the reality** of worldly life.
  * Embrace **life of action** as natural (*prakrti*) to the human mind.
  * Do not perceive a contradiction between **spiritual freedom** and **enjoyment of life**.

> “Together these constitute the fulfillment and enrichment of life.”

---

### 2. **Theory of Purusarthas: The Fourfold Aim of Life**

Hindu sages developed the theory of **Purusarthas** to harmonize life’s pursuits. The four aims are:

1. **Dharma** – moral order, duty, spiritual values
2. **Artha** – wealth, power, material prosperity
3. **Kama** – pleasure, emotional and aesthetic satisfaction
4. **Moksa** – liberation, realization of inner spirituality

* **Dharma** links **kama** and **artha** with **moksa** by regulating them and guiding toward spiritual goals.
* These aims **coordinate** the activities of man for a complete realization of his humanity.

---

### 3. **Moksa: The Ultimate Aim**

* **Moksa** is the ultimate goal and expresses man’s **spiritual nature**.
* Life’s mission is to **unfold this spirituality** and find meaning and joy in it.

#### Human Nature:

* Includes multiple facets:
  * **Instinctive**
  * **Intellectual**
  * **Economic**
  * **Spiritual**
  * **Emotional**
  * **Aesthetic**

#### Integration:

* Hindu thinkers advocate **harmonizing** these varied aspects.
* Instead of **repression**, they promote **sublimation and integration**, producing an **integrated personality**.

> “The struggle of life consisted… in evolving a harmonious blending of these different colours; a melodious symphony of these diverse tunes.”

---

### 4. **Trivarga: The Three Temporal Aims**

The first three Purusarthas—**Dharma, Artha, and Kama**—form the **Trivarga**, or the trilogy of human functions in society.

#### As per Dumont:

> “There are three ‘human ends’, dharma, artha and kama (duty, profit and pleasure)… graded in hierarchy… dharma is more important than artha, which in turn is above kama.”

#### Structural Analysis (Talcott Parsons):

* **Kama**: expressive action (immediate satisfaction)
* **Artha**: instrumental action (calculated and goal-oriented)
* **Dharma**: moral action (universal and sacred)

> “While artha is opposed to kama as deferred satisfaction to immediate satisfaction, dharma is opposed to both as ultimate ends to particular ends, as the sacred to the profane.”

---

### 5. **Kama: Pleasure and Aesthetic Expression**

* Lowest in the **hierarchical order** of aims, to be renounced first if necessary.
* **Includes**:
  * Instinctive drives (esp. **sex**, primarily for **procreation**)
  * **Emotional and aesthetic** aspects of life

#### Importance:

* **Creative expression** is vital for personality development.
* **Emotional repression** is harmful; what is needed is **proper channelling and expression**.

---

### 6. **Artha: Material Prosperity and Ethical Wealth**

* Includes all means for acquiring **wealth or power**.
* Interconnected with **dharma**, not independent of it.

#### Key Concepts:

* **Acquisition of Wealth**
* **Aparigraha** (non-appropriation)
* **Asteya** (non-stealing)

> *Mahabharata*:
> “What is here regarded as dharma depends entirely on wealth… from wealth spring all religious acts, all pleasures and Heaven itself.”

#### Views of Ancient Texts:

* **Kautilya**: Wealth enables charity and desire.
* **Sukraniti Shastra**: Defines wealth as capital (*dharma*), capable of individual appropriation, enjoyment, and a source of prosperity.

#### Balanced Perspective:

* Accumulation is a **means**, not an **end**.
* **Renunciation** is not rejection but **detachment** (*vairagya*).

> “One must acquire these things and cultivate the attitude that they are means towards an ultimate aim and not an end in itself.”

---

### 7. **Dharma: The Guiding Principle**

* Dharma **regulates** the pursuit of artha and kama.
* Ensures that enjoyment and acquisition do not hinder **spiritual realization**.

#### Features:

* **Normative** and **all-dominant** value
* Begins the **trilogy** of Purusarthas
* Governs and guides artha and kama

> *Mahabharata*:
> “The wise man tries to secure all the three, but if all the three cannot be attained, he secures dharma.”

#### Justification:

* **Kama** is essential for domestic life and societal perpetuation.
* **Artha** is necessary to avoid poverty and misery.

> “Universal poverty will spell human extinction after untold misery.”

#### Contributions of Ancient Thinkers:

* **Kautilya** (Arthashastra): importance of artha
* **Vatsyayana** (Kamasutra): significance of kama

---

### 8. **Holistic Life View: Integration of All Aims**

* The theory of **Purusarthas** seeks to **coordinate**:
  * Social desires
  * Sexual and parental instincts
  * Desire for power and property
  * Artistic and cultural pursuits
  * Spiritual aspirations

> “It comprehends life as a whole, its hopes and aspirations, its acquisitions and enjoyments, its sublimation and spiritualization.”

---

## **Āśramas: The Stages of Life in Hindu Thought**

### **1. Foundation: Āśramas and Puruṣārthas**

* The theory of **Puruṣārthas** (Dharma, Artha, Kāma, Mokṣa) is given concrete form in the four **Āśramas**:
  1. **Brahmacarya** (student stage)
  2. **Gṛhastha** (householder stage)
  3. **Vānaprastha** (hermit stage)
  4. **Samnyāsa** (ascetic stage)
* Each stage comes with prescribed **duties and functions** to regulate instinctual life and guide toward **Mokṣa**.

---

### **2. Brahmacarya: The Stage of Studentship**

#### **Initiation into Disciplined Life**

* Life begins with the **Upanayana** (initiation ritual), making one a **dvija** (twice-born).
* Pre-initiation life is undisciplined and purposeless.
* Initiation marks the start of **Vedic education** under a teacher:
  * Duties included tending cattle, collecting fuel, performing sacrifices.
  * Only after the teacher is satisfied with the student's desire for knowledge are the **Vedas** taught.

#### **The Purpose of Vedic Study**

* The Vedas carry the **cultural traditions of the Aryans**.
* Studying them is seen as repaying the **debt to the sages**.
* A man is born with **three debts**:
  1. To the **sages** (through study and literary activity)
  2. To the **gods**
  3. To the **Pitṛs** (ancestors)

#### **Student Discipline and Reverence**

* Emphasis on **reverence for the teacher**:
  * “By censuring his teacher, even when he is just in doing so, he will become an ass in his next birth; and by falsely defaming him he will become a dog.”
  * Proper conduct includes not sitting carelessly, waking before and sleeping after the teacher.

#### **Transmission of Knowledge**

* The **vidyāvamsa** (lineage of knowledge) maintained cultural continuity.
* Religious fraternity extended beyond kinship, involving **social and property rights**.

#### **Daily Routine and Moral Training**

* Students followed strict routines (as per **Dharmasūtras** and **Manusmṛti**):
  * Rise early, late to bed.
  * Control over desires, especially sexual restraint—hence the name **brahmacarya**.

#### **Character Formation**

* Period marked by **emotional instability**, rapid growth, and **impulsiveness**.
* Hindu sages aimed to channel this through:
  * **Mental and physical discipline**
  * Minimal material needs
  * Physical strain and **ascetic training**
  * Encouragement to focus on **higher pursuits**

#### **Spiritual Purpose**

* “Material needs should be few and simple…”
* Prepares for understanding **Dharma**, **Artha**, and **Kāma** in proper perspective.

---

### **3. Gṛhastha: The Householder’s Life**

#### **Objectives of Marriage**

* Aimed at:
  1. **Dharma**
  2. **Praja** (progeny)
  3. **Kāma** (sex)
* Though **personal gratification** is part of it, it’s not the guiding principle.

#### **Five Mahāyajñas** (Great Sacrifices) from Manusmṛti

1. **Brahmayajña**: Reciting Vedas
2. **Pitṛyajña**: Tarpana or Śrāddha
3. **Devayajña**: Burnt offerings to gods
4. **Bhūtayajña**: Offerings to all living creatures
5. **Manuṣyayajña**: Guest hospitality

* Includes offerings to:
  * Dogs, outcastes, cāṇḍālas, diseased individuals, crows, insects.
* Duties go beyond family to embrace all beings.

#### **Social Dimension of Sacrifice**

* Shift from **individualistic** to **social** significance.
* **Pañcamahāyajñas** reoriented yajña towards **humanitarian goals**.
* Reiterated the importance of **living for others**.

> “He who failed to perform these five sacrifices daily lives not through breathes.”

#### **Ethical and Self-Purificatory Role**

* Social duty also serves **individual purification**:
  * Atonement for unintended sins (e.g., killing insects while sweeping).
* **Expanded human sympathy** beyond caste, though still marred by **varna-based discrimination**:
  * E.g., guests treated differently based on **varna**.
  * Brahminical rules reaffirmed social hierarchy, affecting the **ideal of hospitality as yajña**.

---

### **4. Vānaprastha: The Hermit’s Life**

#### **Transition and Discipline**

* Continues **Mahāyajñas** and performs **Agnihotra**, **new/full moon rituals**.
* Begins **detachment from worldly comforts**:
  * Eats roots and fruits, eventually water or air.
  * Accepts physical hardship:
    * Heat of fire in summer, open sky in monsoon, wet clothes in winter.
    * Uses deer skin or bark as clothing; sleeps on earth.

#### **Austerity and Sympathetic Expansion**

* Focuses on:
  * **Self-restraint**
  * **Compassion**
  * **Detachment from bodily needs**
  * **Non-acceptance of charity**

#### **Obligations Beyond the Household**

* Though no longer part of family/village, duties to society remain.
* Devoted to:
  * **Meditation and contemplation**
  * **Serving society as a detached individual**

---

### **5. Samnyāsa: The Life of an Ascetic**

#### **Goal of Mokṣa**

* As per **Gītā**, mokṣa is attained by:
  * **Complete detachment from worldly life**
  * Duties center around **spiritual realization**.

#### **Spiritual Focus**

* Though **social relationships end**, the ascetic is not irrelevant to society:
  * His wisdom and life experience may guide the younger generation.

---

## **CASTE**

### **1. Introduction: Key Features of Indian Social System**

* Two **distinctive features** of the Indian social system:
  * **Caste**
  * **Joint Family**
* Both institutions are currently **at the crossroads**:
  * **Turbulent change factors**
  * **Weakening cementing agencies**
* This discussion on caste (and joint family) is **not conclusive** and is **limited to syllabus needs**.

---

### **2. Etymology and Global Comparison**

* The word **caste** is derived from the **Portuguese word "caste"**, meaning:
  * A **group** with **typical breed**, **race**, or **hereditary qualities**.
* All societies have **stratification systems**, distinguishing groups based on **group characteristics**.
* **Indian caste system is unique** due to:
  * **Untouchability** — *not found anywhere else in the world*.

---

### **3. Indian Terminology and Usage**

* Indian equivalents of caste:
  * **Jati**
  * **Varna**
* **Ironically**, in current usage:
  * **"Caste"** is more commonly used as a **synonym for varna** at the **reference level**
  * And as a **synonym for jati** at the **micro level**

---

### **4. Origins and Historical Development**

#### **Vedic Period: Varna System**

* **Tracing the origin** of the caste system is **literally impossible**
* Multiple **theories** exist, but evidence suggests:
  * **Jati** was **non-existent** during the **Vedic period**
* Society was divided into **four varnas**:
  1. **Priests**
  2. **Warrior class**
  3. **Traders**
  4. **Working class**
* Characteristics of **varna-based division**:
  * Based **mainly on occupation**
  * **Loosely defined divisions**
  * **No barriers** on mobility between varnas
  * **Individual virtues** were credited
  * **Mobility** was **not uncommon**

#### **Post-Vedic Period: Emergence of Jati System**

* **Jati system** is primarily a **post-Vedic phenomenon**
* One of the **thirteen priestly clans** became dominant
* Laid the foundation for:
  * A system where **status was determined by birth**
  * **Mobility between castes** became **uncommon**

---

### **5. Historical Evolution and Contemporary Relevance**

* The **present-day caste system** is the result of **various historical processes**
* In recent times, **other factors** have also brought **changes**
* Yet, **basic characteristics** of the caste system remain **intact**
  * Especially in **most parts of village India**

---

## **Features of Caste System**

*— Prof. G. S. Ghurye (Caste and Race in India, 1969)*

Prof. G. S. Ghurye outlines six key features that define the Indian caste system:

---

### **I. Segmental Division of Society**

* The caste system divides society into **distinct segments**, each with its own:
  * **Privileges**
  * **Status**
  * **Duties**
* Each caste develops a **strong sense of ‘we’ feeling**, making caste interests more important than societal interests.
* **Status is ascribed by birth**, not earned by individual virtues.
* Membership in a caste is:
  * **Hereditary**
  * **Immutable**
* Each caste has **specific norms** that guide:
  * **Intra-caste and inter-caste rights and obligations**
* Breach of these norms is punishable:
  * The **caste council** may impose sanctions, with **ostracism** being the maximum penalty.

---

### **II. Social and Religious Hierarchy**

* Castes are **ranked** in a **hierarchical order** resembling a **ladder**:
  1. **Brahmin** (top)
  2. **Kshatriya**
  3. **Vaishya**
  4. **Shudra** (bottom)
* This hierarchy is maintained through **mythical sanctions**, assigning each caste its place in the order.

---

### **III. Restrictions on Feeding or Social Interaction**

* Each caste has **specific rules** for:
  * **Accepting or giving food** to members of other castes.
* **Higher castes** face **stricter restrictions**, based on the idea of **pollution**.
* For example:
  * A **Brahmin** cannot accept *kuccha food* from someone of a lower caste.
  * **Lower caste individuals** are often **forbidden to touch** higher caste individuals.

---

### **IV. Endogamy**

* Each caste is further divided into **subcastes** with their own **gotras**.
* Marriage rules are governed by:
  * **Gotra exogamy** (cannot marry within the same gotra)
  * **Caste endogamy** (must marry within one’s caste)
* Violation of caste endogamy often results in **ostracism**.
* Historically, **new castes emerged** from unions between **ostracised individuals** and their families.

---

### **V. Fixed Occupation**

* Every caste has a **traditional occupation** that members are expected to follow.
* Members of other castes are **discouraged** or **prevented** from entering these occupations.
* In **modern times**, this feature has **weakened significantly** and is **no longer strictly enforced**.

---

### **VI. Civil and Religious Disabilities**

* **Privileges and restrictions** are distributed **unequally** across castes:

  * **Lower castes** face **civil and religious disabilities**
  * Examples:

    * Prohibited from mixing with higher castes
    * **Reside on the outskirts** of villages or towns
  * **Brahmins** enjoy the most privileges, followed by **Kshatriyas** and **Vaishyas**

---

### **Summary Observation by Ghurye**
> “Of the features of the caste society, **three pertain to the caste as a whole**; for the status in the hierarchy of any sub-caste depends upon the status of the caste, from which follow the various civil and religious rights and disabilities, and the traditional occupation is determined by the nature of the caste.
>
> The **other three** are very material in the consideration of a group from the point of view of an **effective social life**, viz., those that regulate communal life and prescribe rules as regards feeding, social intercourse and endogamy, belong to the sub-caste.”

---

## **Factors of Change in the Caste System**

Caste, although weakening in its traditional form, continues to significantly influence Indian society. Various factors have contributed to its transformation over time. These factors can be categorized as follows:

---

### **(a) Reformist Movements**

* The **spread of education** during British rule exposed the **evils of the caste system**.
* Several **reformist movements** emerged aiming to eradicate caste-based discrimination.
* Contributions of key reformers include:
  * **Swami Dayanand**
  * **Raja Ram Mohan Roy**
  * **Jyotiba Phule**
  * **Swami Vivekanand**
  * **Mahatma Gandhi**
* These movements emphasized **humanity over caste divisions**:

  > “A call to think beyond the narrow caste lines.”

---

### **(b) Legislations**

* **Initial efforts** were made during British rule, often against the **interests of the higher castes**.
* The **real breakthrough** came with **constitutional safeguards** post-independence:
  * **Protective provisions** empowered **lower castes**.
  * Provided **reservations** for **economically and socially deprived** groups.
* This brought about:
  * A **wave of confidence**
  * An **urge for progress**
  * **Equal opportunity** to become **meaningful members of society**

---

### **(c) Modernization**

* **Modern industries** brought people from different castes to **work together**, leading to:
  * **Greater mutual understanding**
  * Breakdown of traditional barriers
* **Traditional caste-based occupations** have become **less rigid**:
  * People are now **free to choose jobs** based on **talent**, not caste
  * Resulted in **higher living standards**
* Other contributing factors:
  * Spread of **caste panchayats**
  * Growth of a **monetary economy** has **reduced the importance** of caste

---

### **(d) Globalisation**

* **Urbanisation** and **Industrialisation** have been accelerated by **globalisation**
* **International economic forces** are:
  * Diffusing **differences between and among castes**
  * Challenging traditional social structures

---

### **Continuing Relevance of Caste**

Despite these changes, caste remains influential:

> “Caste is a dying phenomenon in the traditional sense but its influence on the life of Indians can be only seen to be believed.”

* In **politics**, caste is **the strongest factor**:
  * **Elections** are fought on **caste lines**
* **Inter-caste marriages** are still **stigmatized**
* **Lower castes**, especially in **villages**, are still **looked down upon**
* **Revivalist movements** are:
  * Creating **caste tensions**
  * Hindering **inter-caste understanding**
* The **positive impact of education** is being **undermined** by these divisive trends

---

### **Transition Ahead**

The next section (not included here) will examine the **changes in the position of various castes** in the **social hierarchy**.

---

## **Caste Mobility**

### **Individual Agency and Cultural Manipulation**

* Villagers, particularly **men**, face numerous **choices, decisions, and alternatives** when assuming responsibility for:
  * Their **family**
  * Their **lineage**
  * Their **jati**
  * Their **village**

* In such contexts, a man becomes both:
  * A **manipulator** of his **culture and society**
  * A **creature and carrier** of that culture

> “To be sure, the actual decisions may privately be influenced by the women or the younger people, but the man, the heads of family, the elders and leaders, must give the signal and initiate action.”

---

### **Decisions and Social Cycles**

* Certain **decisions** are rare in an individual's life but may trigger significant **social consequences** beyond anticipation.
* From a broader perspective, these decisions often lead into **repetitive cycles** that form part of the **social system’s regular processes**.

Examples of such decisions:

* Choosing **one girl over another** as a bride for a son
* Opting to **maintain or split** a **joint family**
* Deciding whether to:
  * **Join** an **alliance or affray**
  * **Remain aloof**

> “The cycle of family growth and dispersal is one kind of recurrent change.”

---

### **Focus: Recurrent Social Change through Mobility**

This section emphasizes **recurrent change** in the **social order**, particularly through:

1. **Jati mobility**
2. **Religious regrouping**
3. **Movement from tribal to caste society**

---

### **Approach to Jati Mobility**

The discussion begins with **jati mobility**, exploring:

* **Pressures toward status competition** among jatis
* **Conditions required** for a **successful mobility campaign**
* **Cultural adaptations** made by **ambitious villagers**
* **Tactics** used to **achieve upward mobility**

---

## **Competition Among Jatis**

### **Nature of Jati Mobility and Social Change**

* Recurrent change among **jatis** arises from efforts by **lower jatis** to improve their status.
* **Higher jatis** often resist this, attempting to maintain their superior rank.
* Occasionally, **higher jatis** may lose rank.
* These are **positional changes**, not **structural** ones:

> “The social structure remains quite the same even though one group now is accepted as higher than its former superior and its member outrank those of a previously higher set.”

---

### **Routine Politics vs. Politics of Change**

* **F.G. Bailey** describes such village political contests as **“routine politics”** (vs. politics of change).
* Parallels are drawn to **Max Gluckman’s** contrast between **rebellion and revolution** in African societies.
* Characteristics of routine politics:

  * Repetitive conflicts regardless of who wins
  * Rules of engagement remain the same
  * Endless cycle of similar disputes

> “The logistic, factual, and jural rules of this type of conflict are such that when one group wins it is immediately faced with a similar conflict... down the infinite corridors of structural time, until something happens to change these rules.”

---

### **Corridors of Power and Status Contests**

* These **“corridors of structural time”** are also **corridors of power**.
* Village politics focus on:

  * **Jati rank**
  * **Insignia and prerogatives of rank**
* Wealth and political power are often translated into **ritual status** for legitimacy.
* Hence, **jati mobility** includes both:

  * **Economic mobility**
  * **Political mobility**

---

### **Internal vs. Collective Status Competition**

* Status contests occur:

  * **Within jatis** (intra-jati)
  * **Among jatis** (inter-jati)
* Within jatis:

  * Prosperous individuals enhance the standing of their **family/lineage**
  * Defense becomes collective when **jati rank** is threatened

> “Unless the jati can command a suitable degree of local respect, his gains are incomplete.”

---

### **Limitations of Individual Mobility**

* **Individual mobility** is:

  * **Limited** — higher-ranked neighbors still judge by **jati ritual status**
  * **Ephemeral** — gains may fade without comparable rise of other families in the jati

> “Mobility in rank must be collective if it is to be fruitful and durable.”

---

### **Motivation Behind Collective Mobility**

* Collective mobility is a **central concern**:

  * Especially among **lower jatis**
  * Driven by the belief that **ritual status reflects power**
* Example:

  * **Untouchables** aspire to land ownership to reduce dependence on **landowning patrons**
  * Landowners resist this due to fear of losing access to **polluting services**

---

### **Role of Belief, Myth, and Dharma**

* Belief in **entitlement to higher rank** and **social justice** motivates struggle for mobility.
* Two layers of **origin myths**:

  1. **Societal Myth**:

     * Based on **varna** (as per **Manu** and scriptures)
     * Hierarchy is **immutable**; dharma is fixed
     * Karma determines birth in current station
  2. **Jati-Specific Myth**:

     * Claims descent from **noble/divine ancestors**
     * Encourages struggle to **reclaim rightful heritage**

> “If they are truly to perform their sacred dharma they must struggle to get to loftier rank formally and permanently acknowledged by others.”

---

### **Apparent Contradiction: Immobility vs. Competition**

* The **ideal**: **Social immutability** (fixed varna hierarchy)
* The **reality**: **Social competition** among proximate jatis
* Observers debate:

  * Is caste **noncompetitive** or inherently **competitive**?
* Villagers apply principles **situationally**, not universally

> “Jati rivals do not worry much about the validity of their opponents’ story of origin; it is the validity of one’s own that must be fought out and justified in the village area.”

---

### **Historical Evidence of Jati Competition**

#### **Ancient and Medieval Periods**

* **Ancient guild rivalries** resembled jati competition.
* **Gupta Period**:

  * Silk weavers relocated and achieved higher status.
* **Medieval South India**:

  * Families gained mobility via **geographic migration** and land cultivation.

#### **Seventeenth Century**

* **Abraham Roger** (Dutch missionary, 1631–41, Pulicat):

> “The other castes... there is no unanimity among as to which precedeth, but each mighty claimeth and pretendeth that his own caste is best.”

#### **Eighteenth Century**

* **V.P.S. Raghuvansh** cites European records showing widespread competition.
* Frequent among:

  * **Trading, artisan, cultivating castes**
  * **Untouchable jatis**, e.g., *Pariyas* vs *Chucklers* (right to wear red flowers)

---

### **Modern Echoes and Continuing Rivalries**

* Modern examples:

  * *Malas* vs *Madigas* (Andhra)
  * *Kamars* vs *Reddis* (Andhra)

#### **Even Among Brahmins:**

* Multiple **Brahmin jatis** within a village may **compete** for higher status.

* Example: **Sripuram, Tanjore district**:

  * 12 Brahmin jatis (based on:

    * **Language**: Kannada, Telugu, Tamil
    * **Temple role**: Siva or Vishnu
    * **Doctrine**: Smarthas, Iyengars

* While opposing non-Brahmin political power, they remain **divided among themselves**.

> “They quarreled bitterly among themselves over ritual and other matters.” – Bailey, 1890s

> “It is doubtful whether a definitive answer can be provided, even after detailed consideration of political, economic, and other ‘interactional’ features.”

---

### **Brahmin Prestige and Local Variation**

* **Brahmin jatis** emphasized stories of their **sacred superiority**.
* Acknowledged as **highest varna**, yet:

  * **Gifts/respect** were not universal
  * E.g., In **Punjab**, many Hindus showed only **token deference**

> “Brahmin jatis were not, and are not, immune to status competition.”

* Where multiple Brahmin jatis co-exist, **status claims** are routinely contested.

> “Harijan may have more at stake... but the competitive drive animates people at all levels of village society.”

---

Here is the **reformatted version** of the anthropology text on **"Conditions for Mobility"**, organized for better readability and logical structure. All original terms, authors, and quotes are preserved, and key themes are grouped under clear headings:

---

## **Conditions for Jati Mobility**

### **1. Aspirations and Prerequisites for Mobility**

* **Common Aspiration:** Many jatis aspire to rise in the social hierarchy, but such movement typically spans **generations**.
* **Initial Requirements:**

  * Accumulation of **wealth** and **power** by multiple families.
  * Improvement of **ritual purity**.
  * **Public acceptance** of elevated claims.
* **Limitation:** Mere **reform of jati practices** does not usually result in status elevation.

---

### **2. Role of Wealth and Political Assets**

* **Utility of Wealth and Power:**

  * Similar to **intra-jati status competition**.
  * Political connections can aid in securing economic advantage and vice versa.
  * Both forms of assets are **invested** to **augment jati status**, a more enduring form of village security.

---

### **3. Individual vs. Collective Mobility**

* **Individual Success Stories:**

  * Rare but known. E.g., An untouchable man in **Bispara (Orissa)** became a prosperous hide merchant and landowner.
* **Limitation:**

  * **Individual wealth** alone cannot trigger jati-wide mobility.
  * Collective and **concerted effort** across multiple families is essential.
  * **Courage** to resist **violent reprisals** from others is often necessary.

---

### **4. Case Studies of Jati Mobility**

#### **A. Kayastha (North India)**

* **Traditional Occupation:** Scribes.
* **Shift in Opportunity:**

  * Writing gained value during **Mogul rule** (record-keeping in Persian).
  * Further elevation during **British era** due to administrative utility.
* **Outcome:** Legal battles to be **recognized above Shudra status**.

#### **B. Noniyas (Uttar Pradesh)**

* **Traditional Role:** Salt and saltpeter extraction—viewed as **ritually impure**.
* **Recollection:** In **Senapur (1950s)**, they were considered “almost untouchable”.
* **Transformation:**

  * Shift to agriculture and construction during British infrastructure expansion.
  * Rise of wealthy **Noniya contractors**.
  * Formation of a **jati mobility organization**.
* **Outcome in Senapur:** Ranked **ninth or tenth** among 24 jatis.

---

### **5. Intra-Jati and Regional Disparities**

* **Contrast Within Jati:**

  * **Poor Noniyas** in some villages remain landless and dependent.
  * **Urban Noniyas** in places like **Bombay** present as **middle-class Kshatriyas**.

---

### **6. Popular Saying on Wealth and Status**

> “Last year we were weavers, this year we are Shaikhs, and next year if the harvest is good we shall be Sayyids.”

* **Interpretation:**

  * **Wealth enables ritual purity**, which can lead to **enhanced status**.
  * **Reverse not true**: purity without wealth often brings **no social gain**.
  * **Higher purity is costly** and may provoke **opposition from higher jatis**.

---

### **7. Political Power as a Catalyst for Mobility**

#### **A. Historical Trends**

* In **medieval India**, **rulers of low origin** were often granted **Kshatriya status**.
* **Alliances** with **clan or jati** were critical for power and wealth accumulation.
* **Powerful comrades-in-arms** could then adopt **high ritual appearances**.

#### **B. Royal Grants and Favors**

* **Late 19th Century Punjab:**

  * A British official noted the **Raja of Lambagraon** reinstating **Kolis** to twice-born status.
* **South India Examples:**

  * The **Raja of Chamba** conferred the **sacred thread**.
  * In **Kerala (16th century)**, the **Charmas** were elevated to **military Nayars** by the **Maharaja of Cochin**.

---

### **8. British Rule and New Avenues**

* Under **British administration**, **direct caste interventions ceased**.
* **Political power manipulation** for mobility became **indirect**:

  * Through **litigation** regarding jati prerogatives.
  * Through **education** and advancement in **government jobs**.
* **Effect:** Prestige of the jati could rise via representation in administration, even if not accompanied by tangible rewards.

---

## **Special Resistances to Change in Jati Status**

---

### **1. Structural Inertia in the Caste System**

* **General Pattern:** Jati ranking displays significant **inertia**.
* **Untouchables Face Steep Barriers:**
  * Example: **Holerus** of **Totagadde village (Mysore)**.
    * Faced **resistance to land ownership**.
    * Lack of **skills, education, and capital** limited occupational options.

---

### **2. Cultural Reforms and Social Backlash**

* **Holerus’ Reform Attempts:**
  * Ceased practices like:
    * Eating beef.
    * Removing dead cattle.
    * Supplying wood for funeral pyres.
* **Reaction from Dominant Jati (Havik Brahmins):**
  * Reforms **deprecated** by Haviks.
  * Example:

    > A Havik asserted that Holerus were dirty because they ate beef. When corrected by his own servant that this had stopped 30 years ago, he replied:
    >
    > *“You see, I told you that Holerus are a dirty caste; they used to eat beef!”*

---

### **3. Ritual Display and the Debt Trap**

* **Costly Weddings as Status Symbols:**
  * Holerus spend **1–2 years’ income** on elaborate weddings.
  * Funded via loans from **Havik landowners**, leading to **indentured labor**.
  * **Harper’s Observation:**

    > They “value most that of which they have the least – prestige,” and believe that **rank is linked to marriage rites**.

* **Reality Check:**
  * Lavish rituals showcase cultural conformity but do **not improve jati rank**.
  * Holerus remain at the **bottom of the hierarchy**.
  * Many remain **in constant debt**.
  * There are signs of **revised mobility tactics** among them.

---

### **4. Resistance to Decline Among Brahmins**

* **Contrasting Inertia:**
  * Just as **untouchables struggle to rise**, **Brahmins face resistance to decline**.
* **Survival Strategies for Impoverished Brahmins:**
  * Accept lower-status roles:
    * Performing **funeral rites**.
    * Serving **lowly jati families** who couldn’t afford Brahmins earlier.

---

### **5. Case Studies of Brahmin Decline**

#### **A. Telugu-Speaking Brahmins (Tanjore District)**

* **Context:**
  * Previously served **local aristocracy**.
* **Post-Princely Decline:**
  * Took roles serving **lower jatis** seeking to rise ritually.
  * Example:
    > One Brahmin moved to **Kumbapettai (1947)**, where he:
    > *“ekes out a livelihood by conducting marriage, funeral and ancestral rites for non-Brahmin families.”*

#### **B. “Mahabrahmans”**

* **Definition:** Euphemistically known as "great Brahmins", they specialize in **funerary rites**.
* **Historical Treatment:**
  * In **nineteenth-century Punjab villages**, Mahabrahmans:
    * Were **barred from entering villages**, except for funerary purposes.
* **Contemporary Reality (Ramapur near Allahabad):**
  * **Relatively wealthy** due to pilgrim services.
  * Still **socially ostracized**:

    > *“He may not live in many villages.”*

---

### **6. The Status of “Degraded” Brahmins**

* Found **across India**.
* **Recognized as Brahmins**:
  * Wear **varna insignia**.
  * Officiate rites (especially funerary).
  * Receive **customary Brahmin gifts**.
* **Yet socially distanced:**
  * Neighbors maintain **ritual separation**.
  * One jati obtained a **nineteenth-century rescript** verifying Brahmin status, but:

    > *“Village neighbours continued to treat them as before.”*

---

### **7. Example of Collective Decline**

* **Gangawal Brahmins**:
  * Main **temple priests** at **Gaya pilgrimage centre**.
  * **Recently declined** in status due to economic hardship.

---

## **Importance of the Varna System to Caste**

---

### **1. The Varna Framework and Regional Caste Identities**

* The **five varnas** (Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra, and Panchama/Untouchables) are commonly used to **conceptualize caste hierarchies** across India.
* According to **M.N. Srinivas**, these ancient varnas act as a **pan-Indian caste scheme**—a broad national framework within which local caste identities can be understood.

#### **Example – Khalapur:**

* **Kshatriyas**: Rajputs
* **Vaishyas**: Banias (merchants)
* **Shudras**: Goldsmiths, Carpenters, Blacksmiths, Barbers, Washermen, Watercarriers, Jogis, Mirasis, Gosains
* **Panchalas/Untouchables**: Shoemakers, Chamar Leather-workers, Sweepers

---

### **2. The Southern India Variation**

* In **South India**, the varna structure appears less aligned with traditional varna definitions:
  * Absence of clearly identifiable **Kshatriyas or Vaishyas**.
  * **Rulers** sometimes **legitimized themselves as Kshatriyas** through **Brahmanical rituals**.

#### **Caste Classification in South India:**

* **Nayars (Kerala)**: Considered **Shudras**, not Kshatriyas.
* **Chettiars (traders)**: Considered **Shudras**, not Vaishyas.
* **Vellalas (landowning cultivators)**: Considered **Shudras**, not Kshatriyas.
* Regional division tends to follow:
  * **Brahmans**
  * **Non-Brahmans**
  * **Untouchables / Adi-Dravidas ("Original South Indians")**

---

### **3. Varna and Local Caste Mobility Efforts**

* While **regional caste identity** is often more relevant, the **varna framework** remains significant in **jati mobility claims**.
* **Shudra or Untouchable castes** often argue that their **low varna status** is a **historical error or injustice**, asserting that:
  > “We were once Brahmans or Kshatriyas, but our status declined due to historical accident.”

* These communities support their claims with **status-legends** aimed at correcting this perceived historical misplacement.

---

### **4. Caste Mobility Through Census and Claims**

#### **The Case of the Shanans (Tamil Nadu):**

* Traditionally tapped **palmyra trees** for juice, used for sugar and toddy.
* Claimed **Kshatriya status**, demanded to be known as **Nadars** (“Lords of the Land”).
* **Result**:
  * The term "Nadar" has gained recognition.
  * Yet:
    > *“It is doubtful that non-Nadars consider Nadars to be Kshatriyas.”*
    > (Hardgrave 1969: 81)

---

### **5. The Sweepers of Khalapur and Their Dual Claims**

* Claimed **descent from Valmiki**, author of the *Ramayana*.
* Also claimed **Rajput (Kshatriya) ancestry**:
  * Originally **Bhil Rajputs**.
  * **Conquered by Ashoka (c. 250 B.C.)**, fled to forests.
  * Returned to village life as **Untouchables**.

> *“After conquest, we continued our tribal life for some time, but then some of us settled in villages composed of several Hindu castes; we became such a caste, but one of Untouchable status; we are dissatisfied with that status and wish to change it.”*
> (Mahar 1958; Kolenda 1964)

* These myths **reflect tribal integration into the caste system**, often at **low rank**.

---

### **6. Tribal Integration and Varna Assignment**

#### **Low-ranking Entry:**

* **Chuhra**: Name for Sweepers, believed to be an earlier **Punjabi tribe**.
* In **Bengal**, **Santal tribesmen** today form **landless agricultural labourer jatis**.

#### **High-ranking Entry:**

* Some tribal groups **successfully claimed higher varna**:
  * **Gonds (Central India)** and **Coorgs (South India)**: Claimed **Kshatriya** status.
  * Some **tribal priests** laid claim to **Brahman varna** rank.

---

### **7. Mechanisms for Upward Mobility**

* Merely asserting higher status is **not enough** for a jati to rise in rank.
* **Effective methods** of improving rank differ by period:

#### **Traditional India:**

* **Force of arms**

#### **Modern India:**

* **Accumulated wealth**

#### **Common to Both:**

* **Proximity to political power**

---

## **Upward Caste Mobility Before British Rule**

---

### **1. Means of Caste Mobility in Pre-British India**

* Before British **unification and pacification** (first half of the 19th century), **caste mobility** was most effectively achieved through:
  * **Conquest**
  * **Peaceful occupation of sparsely populated areas**
* **M.N. Srinivas** calls this:
  > *“Mobility through resort to warfare”*
* He cites **K.M. Panikkar**, who observed:
  > *“Since the fifth century B.C., every known royal family has come from a non-Kshatriya caste.”*

---

### **2. Conquest and Caste Elevation**

#### **Caste and the Conqueror**

* Since the time of the **Mauryan Empire** (322 B.C. – 183 B.C.), regions of the Indian subcontinent have been ruled by various dynasties:
  * Some by **Muslims or Christians (post-European conquest)**
  * Hindu-ruled kingdoms were **often led by lowly varna jatis**
* **Mechanism of Mobility**:
  * A **low-caste jati** with land could convert wealth into **military strength**.
  * Successful conquest allowed these groups to **establish kingdoms** and **claim Kshatriya status**.
  * The ruler’s **kin group or caste** often rose in status with him.

---

### **3. Example: Shivaji and the Marathas**

* **Shivaji** (18th century) exemplifies upward caste mobility:
  * His father was a **jagirdari** under the Muslim ruler of Bijapur.
  * **Shivaji overthrew the Moghuls** and created a **Hindu empire**.
  * His caste, the **Marathas**, were originally of **Shudra varna**.
* To gain legitimacy:
  > Shivaji underwent a **religious rite** of **transition into Kshatriyahood**.
* As a result:
  * The **Maratha caste** also gained **Kshatriya rank**.

---

### **4. Caste Rise Through Service to Rulers**

#### **Examples of Jatis Benefiting from Political Patronage**

* **Patidars of Gujarat** (Shudra peasants):
  * Supported the **Maratha Gaekwads**
  * Gradually **claimed Kshatriya status** and established **small regimes**
    *(Shah 1964)*
* **Kayasthas** (scribes):
  * Rose through **government service**
  * But their eastern counterparts in **Bengal** remained **Shudras**
    *(Cohn in Silverberg 1968: 122–123)*
* **Brahman Purohits** (chaplains):
  * Gained from **Khatri patronage** in Punjab
  * Were supportive of Khatris’ claims to **Kshatriya status**
    *(Rowe 1968: 203)*

---

### **5. Familial Mobility and New Jati Formation**

#### **Historical Insight by Burton Stein**

* In **medieval South India**, mobility occurred **through families** rather than jatis:
  * Association with **Muslim rulers** facilitated this rise.
* **Srinivas** notes:
  > *“Such familial upward mobility was likely to result in the formation of a new jati out of an established larger one.”*
* Mechanism of jati formation:
  * **Close intermarriage** among a few families
  * Especially effective in **South India**, where **cross-cousin and uncle-niece marriages** were preferred
  * In **two generations**, such families could become a **closed endogamous jati** with a **distinct identity and higher rank**
    *(Srinivas 1968: 196)*

---

### **6. Authority of Hindu Rulers Over Caste Matters**

* An **orthodox Hindu ruler** had considerable authority over caste affairs:
  * Could **outcaste individuals**
  * Adjust **jati ranks**
  * Enforce **untouchability**
  * Regulate **marriage norms**
* These powers **continued into the 20th century** in **non-British princely states** (comprising one-third of the subcontinent), mostly ruled by **Hindus**.
* Such powers still exist in **Nepal**, an **independent Hindu kingdom**.

---

## **Upward Caste Mobility Under British Rule**

### **1. Role of the British Censuses in Caste Identity**

* During British rule, especially from **1891 to 1931**, the **Indian Census** became a platform for caste groups to seek **upward mobility**.
* The British administration recorded **jati identities**, unintentionally providing an opportunity for castes to attempt changes in their social status.

---

### **2. Caste Claims for Higher Varna Status**

* Many **middle and low castes** actively attempted to **redefine themselves** as members of the **twice-born varnas** (*Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya*).
* This **trend peaked in the 1901 Census**, under **Herbert Risley**, who attempted to **rank all castes**.
> *“Hundreds of jatis tried to ensure a higher rank by claiming high varna titles.”*
* Examples of such efforts:
  * **Kurmi cultivators** of Bengal: wanted to be known as **Kurmi Kshatriyas**
  * **Teli oil-pressers**: wanted to be called **Vaishyas**
* To support these claims:
  * Castes submitted **myths** and **so-called historical evidence**.
  * Many jatis sought to **separate themselves from lower-status counterparts** within the same caste.

> *“Castes already established as Kshatriyas or Brahmans or Vaishya also complained about inferior jatis to their varna”*
> — (Srinivas 1968: 195)

---

### **3. Volume of Petitions and Administrative Response**

* In **Bengal**, a single Census official reported:
  > *“Petitions submitted by jatis seeking high varna titles or the name of a higher-ranking jati weighed 120 pounds.”*
* In response:
  * **Committees** were formed to **evaluate these claims**.
  * Most of these claims were **not upheld**.
  * However, inconsistencies occurred:
    * A petition could be **approved in one district** but **rejected in another** for a different segment of the same caste.

> *“A ruling in a jati’s favour was looked upon as the British government functioned in somewhat the same way as the Hindu kings had in adjudicating caste affairs.”*

---

### **4. Discontinuation of Jati Recording Post-1931**

* Since **1931**, the **Censuses of India** have **stopped recording jati identities**, marking the end of this British-administered path to caste redefinition.

---

## **The Tools for Counting**

---

### **1. Opposition to Caste Data Collection in 2011**

* As the **2011 Census** approached, **R. Chidambaram**, then Union Home Minister, opposed the inclusion of **caste data**.
* He argued that it was **logistically impossible** to collect caste data via the Census.
* Instead, it was proposed that caste data be collected through the **Below Poverty Line (BPL) Census**, which was later renamed the **Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC)**.

---

### **2. Issues with the SECC Data**

* The **hasty inclusion** of caste questions in the SECC led to:
  * **Largely unusable data**
* The government assigned **former NITI Aayog chairman Arvind Panagariya** to investigate the matter.
  * However, the **effort stalled**, and no effective resolution was reached.

---

### **3. Dependence on Historical Data**

> *“Consequently, if we want information regarding the size and characteristics of various castes in India, we must continue to look to the Census of 1931.”*

* Despite being nearly a century old, the **1931 Census** remains the most detailed source for caste demographics in India due to the failure to update this data meaningfully.

---

### **4. Concerns for Future Censuses**

* It is anticipated that the **2021 Census** will again face **demands for caste data collection**.
* Yet, signs suggest that the country will once more be **unprepared** for a **full caste census**.

---

### **5. Call for Proactive Planning**

> *“If we really want to collect data on caste in India and not let the discourse about Indian society be shaped by the political exigencies of colonial India, the time to plan is now.”*

* The author emphasizes the **urgent need for strategic planning** to ensure that caste data is collected in a **comprehensive and usable** manner.

---

## **An Ongoing Argument**

---

### **1. The Debate: Should We Collect Caste Data?**

* Some argue that:
  * **Asking about caste** itself creates societal divisions.
  * The roots of this resistance lie in **colonial practices** of classification and administration.
> *"Part of this resistance comes from the preoccupation of colonial administrators-turned-arm-chair anthropologists who saw caste as the defining feature of Indian society."*

---

### **2. Role of Colonial Censuses**

* **Colonial Censuses** began in **1871** and:
  * Included **caste questions**.
  * Were used to **divide and conquer** Indian society.
  * Initially **privileged Brahmins** as cultural interpreters.
  * Later **blamed Brahmins** as the origin of caste-based oppression and inequality.

---

### **3. Scholarly Reactions to Colonial Classifications**

* **G.S. Ghurye**, early 20th-century Indian sociologist:
  * Criticized colonial classifications.
  * Saw them as fueling **anti-Brahmin movements**.
* **Veena Das**, a leading figure in modern Indian anthropology:
  * Argued that:
> *"The colonial Censuses via the process of recording caste generated a conception of community as a homogeneous and classifiable community and thereby influenced the processes of political representation."*

---

### **4. Post-Independence Census Practices**

* As a result of colonial legacy and criticism:
  * **Post-Independence Censuses** have largely **avoided caste questions**.

---

### **5. The Present-Day Dilemma**

* Key question:
  > *Will caste-based politics and sentiments disappear if we stop collecting caste data?*
* Evidence suggests otherwise:
  * Groups like **Patels, Gujjars, Jats**, and **Marathas** actively demand **reservations** **regardless** of the absence of recent caste Census data.
  * In **Karnataka elections**, caste politics continues:
    * Despite only **rough estimates** of the population sizes of **Lingayat** and **Vokkaliga** communities.

---

## **What is at Stake?**

---

### **1. Current Assumptions About Caste in India**

* **Broad caste categories** such as:
  * *Dalits*
  * *Adivasis*
  * *Other Backward Classes (OBCs)*
  * *Upper Castes*
* These are still used by:
  * **Political system**
  * **Civil society**
  * **Courts**
* These categories are **primarily based on data** from:
  * The **1931 Census**
  * A few **special-purpose surveys**

> *Without accurate, granular data for thousands of jatis (castes) and upjatis (subcastes), we cannot verify if these assumptions are still valid in 21st-century India.*

---

### **2. Transformations Since 1931**

* **Changes in Land Ownership:**
  * Former upper-caste landowners are now **marginal farmers** due to:
    * **Land fragmentation**
    * **Agricultural stagnation**
* **Dalit Mobility:**
  * Historically **landless**, Dalits have:
    * Benefited from **rising rural wages**, especially in **construction**

---

### **3. Evidence from Surveys**

* **National Sample Survey (NSS):**
  * Shows higher **mean consumption expenditure** for forward castes compared to Dalits.
  * However, it also reveals that:
    > *"The bottom fourth of forward castes are poorer than the top half of Dalits."*

* **India Human Development Survey:**
  * Literacy levels among children (ages 8–11):
    * **56% of Dalit children** cannot read
    * **32% of forward caste children** cannot read
    * **47% of OBC children** cannot read

---

### **4. The Need for Updated Caste Data**

* Due to:
  * **Economic growth**
  * **Affirmative action policies**
* Outcomes:
  * Some **jatis have risen** from poverty.
  * Others may have **fallen into** marginalisation.

> *It is now necessary to collect caste data that reflects present-day social and economic realities.*

---

### **5. Challenges of Caste Data Collection**

* **SECC (Socio-Economic and Caste Census):**
  * Interviewers asked to record **caste names as spoken by respondents**
  * Resulted in up to **46 lakh caste entries**
  * Issues included:
    * **Variations in spelling**
    * Mixing of **jati** and **upjati** names
    * Difficulty in creating **mutually exclusive categories**

> *The Ministries of Rural Development and Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation had to include the caste question in SECC at the last moment, without preparation.*

---

### **6. Opportunities for Improvement**

* **Three years before the 2021 Census** offers a window of preparation.
* Tools available:
  * **SECC data**
  * **Machine learning technologies**
* Proposed steps:
  1. Form an **expert group**.
  2. Use SECC data + other sources (e.g., matrimonial ads, SC/OBC lists).
  3. Generate a **comprehensive list** of castes.
  4. **Condense** using machine learning into **meaningful categories**.
  5. **Validate** through domain experts from **ICSSR** institutions.
  6. Prepare **district-specific caste lists** covering 90%+ of the population.

* **Field Implementation:**

  * Enumerators would use this **pre-seeded list** for self-classification.
  * Remaining castes could be recorded **verbatim** and **categorized later**.

> *This approach is similar to techniques used for occupational and industrial classification systems.*

Here is your anthropology reading titled **"Genie's Out Already"** reformatted for better readability and logical flow. All content, keywords, and author references have been preserved exactly as in the original.

---

## **Genie's Out Already**

---

### **1. Inherent Risks in Caste Data Collection**

* Collecting data on caste is recognized as **inherently risky**.
* **Politicians** are aware of both:
  * The **advantages** of mobilizing support based on caste.
  * The **dangers** of stoking **relative deprivation** among groups.

> *"A caste Census could easily roil the waters in ways that are hard to predict."*

---

### **2. Impact of SECC**

* Despite the risks, once the **Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC)** was conducted,
  > *“the genie was out of the bottle.”*
* There are now **widespread demands** for the **release of SECC data**.

---

### **3. Way Forward**

* While the **SECC data may be flawed**, acknowledging this and working toward **improving data collection methods** could:
  * Help **diffuse tensions**
  * Serve as a **strategic move before the 2019 election**
