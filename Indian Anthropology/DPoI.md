# **Demographic Profile of India**

## **Ethnic (Biogenetic) Diversity in India**

India exhibits a wide spectrum of **cultural** and **biological** variation. This diversity emerges from differences in:

* **Regions**
* **Religions**
* **Social preferences**

These differences have led to both **marked and subtle biological variations** across the population.

### **People of India (POI) Project – Key Findings**

Conducted by the **Anthropological Survey of India**, under the *Peoples of India* project, the findings are extensively documented in **Bhalla et al. (1994)**.

#### **Community Data:**

* **Total communities identified:** Over **4,635**
  * **Scheduled Tribes (ST):** 462
  * **Scheduled Castes (SC):** 449
* After accounting for:
  * Community presence across multiple states
  * Synonyms and variations in names
    → The **consolidated national list** includes **approximately 2,200 communities**

### **Research Gaps and Data Coverage**

* **Tribal Communities:**
  * Bio-anthropological data available for **172** communities
* **Scheduled Caste Communities:**
  * Data available for only **51** communities
* **Other Sections (including caste populations):**
  * Some sizeable data exists
  * However, the **overall picture remains incomplete** due to gaps in knowledge

### **Types of Bio-Anthropological Data Used:**

Data includes both **primary** and **secondary sources** focused on:

* **Serological traits**
* **Biochemical traits**
* **Selected morphological traits**

These were utilized in the POI project to study **biological variation** in Indian populations.

---

## **Historical Background**

### **Population Structure**

The **Indian population** is historically divided into **numerous endogamous groups**, including:

* **Castes**
* **Tribes**
* **Religions**
* **Minorities**
* **Scheduled Castes**

#### **Basis of Reproductive Isolation:**

* **Geographic**
* **Religious**
* **Ethnic**
* **Occupational**

### **Antiquity and Migrations**

* India has a **long human history**, stretching back to **Palaeolithic times**
* Although **skeletal remains** are scarce, abundant **stone implements** provide evidence of dense prehistoric habitation

#### **Migration Waves:**

* Multiple **waves of migrants** entered India in **prehistoric and historic periods**
* Consequences of these migrations:
  * **Earlier settlers** were pushed **southwards and eastwards** into more isolated regions
  * These groups often maintained **greater purity of genetic stock**
  * Some migrant groups retained their **genetic identity**
  * Others **interbred** with local populations

> *"Cases are not rare that populations living side by side for hundreds or even thousands of years have retained their genetic differences by practicing endogamy."*

## **Ethnic Classifications in India**

### **Early Morphological Studies**

* **Initial Studies:**
  Morphological studies of Indian populations began as early as **1868**.
* **Risley (1915):**
  Presented the **first systematic study** of Indian populations.
  He classified Indian people into the following types:
  * **Turko-Iranian**
  * **Indo-Aryan**
  * **Scythio-Dravidian**
  * **Aryo-Dravidian** (*Hindustan type*)
  * **Mongolo-Dravidian** (*Bengali type*)
  * **Mongoloid type**
  * **Dravidian type**

### **Subsequent Classifications by Scholars**

#### **Haddon (1924)**

* Divided India into **three main geographic regions** to study racial elements.

#### **Eickstedt (1934)**

* Based on **morphology and culture**, he proposed four main divisions:
  * **Veddoid** (*Ancient Indian*)
  * **Melamid** (*Black Indian*)
  * **Indid** (*Neo-Indian*)
  * **Palae-Mongoloid**

#### **Guha (1935)**

* Conducted a comprehensive **morphological survey** of India.
* His classification included:
  * **Negrito**
  * **Proto-Australoid**
  * **Mongoloid**
  * **Mediterranean**
  * **Nordic**

#### **Sarkar (1961)**

* Proposed **six main ethnic elements** in India:
  * **Australoid**
  * **Indo-Aryan**
  * **Irano-Scythian**
  * **Mundari speakers**
  * **Far-Eastern**
  * **Mongoloid**

### **Simplified Model: Malhotra (1978)**

* Adapted a **simplified version** of Guha's classification.
* Suggested **four broad morphological types** contributing to the biological composition of the People of India:
  * **Negrito**
  * **Australoid**
  * **Mongoloid**
  * **Caucasoid**

#### **Ethnic Distribution According to Malhotra:**

* **Australoid:**
  Believed to be the **oldest** group in the subcontinent, primarily found among **South and Central Indian tribals**.
* **Caucasoid:**
  Predominantly represented in **populations under caste organization**.
* **Mongoloid:**
  Associated mainly with **tribals of North-East India**.

### **Contemporary Relevance**

> *"With some modifications, the classification proposed by Guha continues to find favour with physical anthropology as the best available model of ethnic diversity in the Indian region."*

## **Ethnic (Racial) Elements in India**

### **Challenges in Understanding Racial Composition**

Understanding the **racial elements** of the people of India presents significant difficulties due to the **scanty nature of evidence**.

#### **Key Issues:**

* The **exact identity** of various ethnic groups that inhabited different parts of India remains **uncertain** due to the **lack of direct evidence**.
* While **stone artifacts** from prehistoric populations (e.g., **Lower Palaeolithic period**) have been discovered, there is a **notable absence of prehistoric human skeletons**.
  * The **only significant find** is the **skull cap of the Narmada Man**.

### **Limitations in Historical and Prehistoric Evidence**

* **Prehistoric Period:**
  * Stone artifacts suggest human presence.
  * However, **no substantial skeletal remains**, aside from the Narmada Man, have been found.
* **Historic Period:**
  * Evidence regarding **racial composition** during this time is also **insufficient**.
  * This lack of concrete data makes it **difficult to trace** the racial history of the Indian population.

### **Dependence on Assumptions and Need for Research**

* Multiple scientists have attempted to provide **racial classifications**, but:
  * They have **relied heavily on assumptions** due to limited evidence.
  * **Repeated scientific research** using **modern methodologies** is essential to uncover the **racial history** of the Indian subcontinent.

> *"Different scientists have tried to classify the racial classifications as far as they could; but all the time, they have to depend on assumptions."*

> *"Repeated scientific researches, in the modern light, are needed to unveil the racial history of this sub-continent."*

---

### **Criticism of Risley’s Classification**

#### **General Critique**

Risley's classification has been **widely criticized** for inaccuracies, assumptions, and lack of cultural and linguistic consideration.

#### **Specific Criticisms:**

* **Turko-Iranian Type**:
  * Describing N.W\.F.P. population as "round-headed" was inaccurate.
* **Scythian Element in Bombay Presidency**:
  * Risley emphasized Scythian influence, although **Scythian presence was brief**, limiting their impact on local ethnic composition.
* **Brachycephalic Elements in Bengal**:
  * Risley attributed these to **Mongolian influence**, but:
    > “All Mongolian people do not possess broad heads.”
  * Also, **epicanthic fold**, a Mongoloid trait, is:
    > “Totally absent among the castes of the other parts of Bengal.”
* **Indo-Aryans’ Distribution**:
  * According to Risley, limited to Punjab, Rajputana, Kashmir Valley.
  * However, **Aryan language speakers are widely spread**.
* **Kashmiris**:
  * Should have been placed in a separate category due to **distinct physical features**.
* **Aryo-Dravidian and Dravidian Types**:
  * Lacked clear definition.
  * Risley’s **Dravidian region** (Vindhya to Cape Comorin, Aravalli to Rajmahal) included:
    * People who **do not speak Dravidian languages**
    * Groups with **different physical traits**

---

#### **Alternative Views**

* **Deniker**:
  * Argued Risley’s Dravidians include two distinct types:
    1. Long head, medium stature, narrow nose
    2. Long head, short stature, broad nose
  * These groups differ in **physical features, culture, and origin**
* **Pre-Dravidian Theory**:
  * The second type described above is often called **Pre-Dravidian**.
* **Chanda’s View**:
  * Compared this Pre-Dravidian group to **Nishada**, mentioned in Puranas as:
    > “Very low statured, low tipped nose, copper coloured hair and body complexion is as dark as that of crow.”

---

#### **Omission Noted**

* **Negrito Element**:
  * Risley **did not account** for the **Negrito presence** in India.

---

## **Haddon's Classification of Indian Racial Elements**

**A.C. Haddon**, in reconstructing the **racial background of India**, divided the Indian subcontinent into **three main geographical regions** and analyzed the **ethnic elements** in each.

---

### **Geographical Division**

1. **The Himalayas**

---

### **Haddon's Basis of Classification**

Haddon used a combination of **physical characteristics**, **customs**, **language**, and **folk-tales** to determine racial elements.

> “With the help of these evidences he presented his own analysis of racial elements.”

---

### **Haddon's Historical Interpretation**

* **Oldest inhabitants** of India:
  > “The oldest people of India must have been the pre-Dravidians.”
* **Dravidians**:
  * Regarded as original inhabitants of the **Ganges region in Western Bengal**
* **Aryan-speaking people**:
  * Arrived in the **second millennium B.C.**
  * Initially settled in **Punjab**
  * Later expanded to **valleys of the Jamuna and the Ganges**

---

### **Unresolved Aspects in Haddon’s Theory**

* **Unclear stance** on **Pre-Aryan India**
* **Brachycephalic element** in India is said to be of **Alpine origin**, but without detailed clarification

---

## GUHA'S CLASSIFICATION

**Basis of Classification:**
Guha's classification is based on original anthropometric measurements collected during the **1931 Census operation**.

---

### **Criticism of Guha's Classification**

1. **Negrito Element:**
   * Rejected by many leading anthropologists.

2. **Foreign Origin Claim:**
   * Guha argued that **all races in India are of foreign origin**.
   * **Keith opposed**, asserting:
   > "India may be an evolutionary field of different races."

3. **Brachycephaly Distribution:**
   * Guha noted a sweeping brachycephalic spread from:
     * **North-West (Afghanistan, Beluchistan, Sind)** into the Deccan
     * **East (Bhutan, Tibet)** through Assam and Bengal
   * **Sarkar’s Counterpoint:**
     * Disagreed with Guha’s sweeping claim
     * Argued that **brachycephaly is localized**, not widespread
     * High frequencies found in:
       * **Kakars (N.W\.F.P.) – 76%**
       * **Chakmas (Chittagong) – 77%**
       * **Limbus (Nepal) – 82%**

**Guha’s View on Origins:**

* Brachycephaly of Gujarat and Maharashtra = **Scytho-Iranian**
* N.W\.F.P. brachycephaly = **Pamir origin**
* Nepal and Chittagong = **Mongolian and Malay origin respectively**

---

## **Sarkar's Classification of Indian Ethnic Strains**

Sarkar, based on **extensive fieldwork** and **cephalic index**, proposed that **India is predominantly a dolichocephalic country**, and identified **three major ethnic strains**.

---

### **I. The Dolichocephals**

Three distinct groups are associated with dolichocephalic head forms:

#### **(a) VEDDIDS – The Autochthones of India**

* **Origin**: Linked to the **Veddas of Sri Lanka**.
* **Distribution**: Widespread across India.
* **Migration**: Likely entered India via a **land bridge** from Sri Lanka in ancient times.
* **Evidence**:
  * **Osmond Hill’s study**: 28.1% of Veddas are **hyper-dolichocephalic**.
  * **Kappers’ view**: Hyper-dolichocephalic skulls at Mohenjodaro indicate **Veddid features**.

##### **Tribal Examples (India):**

* **South India**:
  * Uralis
  * Kannikars
  * Muthuvans (Travancore)
  * Kurumba, Irula (Nilgiri Hills)
  * Chenchus (Hyderabad)
  * Kadars (Cochin)
* **North India**:
  * The Male
  * The Panih

##### **Presence Outside India:**

* **Western side**:
  * Hadhramaut (Southern Arabia)
  * Persia
* **Eastern side**:
  * Sakar (Malay Peninsula)
  * Orang Batin
  * Nias Islanders
  * Toalas (Celebes)
  * Moi (Indo-China Hills)

> “South India may be considered as the centre of Veddids. They seem to have been more widespread throughout the length and breadth of the country than it appears at present.”

---

#### **(b) The Dravidians of South India**

* **Origin**: Thought to have evolved from **Veddids**.
* **Influencing Factors**: Changes in **climate**, **environment**, and **food habits** affected ethnic features.
* **Example of Ecological Influence**:
  * **Male of Rajmahal Hills** migrated to plains and became known as **Malpaharias**, exhibiting **distinct physical changes** from their parent stock.

---

#### **(c) The Indo-Aryans**

* **Arrival**: Entered India around **1200 B.C.** via the **North-Western gate**.
* **Settlement Areas**:
  * Plains of the **Indus** and **Ganges**
  * Extended up to the **border of Bengal**
* **Language & Culture**: Had a **distinct set** compared to the native population.
* **Outcome**: Gradual **intermixture** with autochthonous groups, leading to changes in physical traits over time.

---

### **II. The Brachycephals**

Sarkar identified **four major sources** of **brachycephalic population** in India:

1. **Irano-Scythian element**
2. **Central Asian element** (arrived during the **prehistoric period**)
3. **Nalayan group** (inhabiting **coastal Chittagong** and **Tiruneveli**)
4. **Mongolian element**

---

### **III. Reflections on Racial Classifications**

* **Basis of Classifications**: Varies depending on different **criteria**.
* **Complexity**: The **racial composition of India** is extremely complex.
* **Reasons**:
  * Continuous **fusion of population elements** since ancient times.
  * Multiple authorities have proposed differing systems.
* **Current Need**:

> “At the present stage we need a fresh technique based on modern and latest information which would help in classifying the races of India.”

---

## **The Negrito Racial Element in India**

### **1. Early Theories and Debates**

#### **De Quartrefages’ Theory (1877)**

* Proposed that the **Negrito** were the earliest inhabitants of India.
* Suggested Negrito influence from Malaysia into India.

#### **Supporters**

* **Keane**: Supported De Quartrefages’ theory; suggested Negrito racial strains in:
  * **Veddas** of Ceylon
  * **Kadars, Irulas, Kurumbas, Vallalas** of South India
* **Lapicque**: Initially found Negrito traits among the Kadars.
* **Haddon**: Supported Keane partially; believed in an early **Negroid race in Susiana** influencing India.

#### **Critics**

* **V. Ball (1895)**: Rejected De Quartrefages’ theory as baseless.
* **Lapicque (later)**: Withdrew his initial claim after not finding true Negrito traits.
* **Risley**: Rejected presence of woolly hair; dismissed Negrito element in India.
* **Major Molesworth, Fowler, Turner**: Stated Andamanese were distinct from Indian aborigines.

---

### **2. The Andamanese Hypothesis**

#### **Views Against**

* **Risley** (The Peoples of India):
  > “The Andamanese have no share in the making of Indian population.”
* **Major Molesworth**: Physical features of Andamanese differ from Indian tribes.
* **Fowler & Turner**: Supported Molesworth’s conclusion.
* **Dravidian populations**: Differ in many respects from Andamanese.

---

### **3. Contributions and Criticisms: J.H. Hutton**

#### **Evidence Provided**

* Presence of **woolly and frizzly hair** in **Angami Nagas (Manipur, Cachar hills)**.
* Cultural parallels from Melanesians:
  * **Disposal of dead by exposure**
  * **Separation of skull**
  * **Head-hunting**
  * **Ficus tree cult**

#### **Criticisms**

* **Majumdar**:
  * Traits’ distribution in India is limited.
  * Traits like **canoe cult**, **megalithic cult** need not be Melanesian in origin.
  * Cultural parallels do not always indicate diffusion.

---

### **4. Guha’s Findings and the Debate**

#### **Guha**

* Found 16 individuals with **woolly hair** among the **Kadars**.
* Used this to argue for a **Negrito substratum** in India.

#### **Supporters**

* **Ehrenfels**: Supported Guha’s observation on hair type.

#### **Opponents**

* **Sarkar**:
  * Warned against drawing broad conclusions from hair form alone.
  * Criticized vague usage of terms like "woolly" and "frizzly".
  * Claimed genetic reasons may explain sporadic appearance of such traits.

> “Phenotypically similar hair may have different genotypical features.”

* **Majumdar**:
  * Highlighted inconsistency:
    * **Quatrefages** described Negrito as **brachycephalic**
    * **Guha** described **Kadars as dolichocephalic**

* **Sarkar**:

  * Acknowledged failure to confirm Negrito presence scientifically despite multiple studies.

---

### **5. Aiyappan’s Observation**

* Tribes are **indistinguishable from local populations**.
* Described as:
  > “Flesh of our flesh.”
* **Frizzly hair** is rare, countable on fingertips.

---

### **6. Skeletal Evidence**

#### **Mohenjodaro Skeletons**

* **Proto-Australoid features** in some skulls.
* **Two distinct types**:
  * Long head, high cranium → Proto-Australoid
  * Narrow nose, slender bodies → **Mediterranean race**

#### **Other Studies**

* **Zuckerman** (Tinne Valley):
  * 1 skull: Australoid
  * 5 skulls: Mediterranean
* **Elliot Smith (Adichanallur)**:
  > “Australoid or proto-Australoid features are common throughout India.”

> If Negrito assimilation occurred, **Negroid characteristics** should appear more widely in **North India**, but they do not.

---

### **7. Serological Studies and Genetic Traits**

#### **Findings**

* **Indian Tribes vs. Negroes**:
  * **Indians**: Low B incidence
  * **Negroes**: High B incidence
* **Australoids**: Typically A group
* **Interior Tribes**: High A group
* **Bhils & Mundas**: Show B group, but no Negrito physical traits

#### **Conclusion**

* Lack of serological resemblance to Negroes.
* **Insufficient data** to draw conclusions.
* Further research needed.

---

### **8. Conclusion on Racial Origins**

* **Proto-Australoids** likely the **earliest inhabitants**.
* Possible **African or Negrito infiltration**, but unconfirmed.
* More research required for conclusive evidence.

---

### **9. Population Studies in India**

#### **General Observations**

* Wide morphological and genetic variation across populations.
* Numerous studies on regional ethnic classification:
  * **U.P.** – Mahalanobis, Majumdar, Rao (1949)
  * **Gujarat** – Majumdar & Sen (1950)
  * **Maharashtra** – Karve & Dandekar (1951)
  * **Bengal** – Majumdar & Rao (1960)
  * **Tamil Nadu** – Malhotra, Balakrishnan & Karve (1981)
  * **Himachal Pradesh** – Sharma & Bhalla (1987)
* Mostly focused on **morphometrics**; few on serology/biochemical markers.

#### **Genetic Survey Findings**

* **Balakrishnan (1978)**:
  * Calculated genetic distances among 102 populations.
  * Identified 4 main clusters:
    * **Caucasoid Aryans**
    * **Caucasoid Dravidians**
    * **Australoid**
    * **Mongoloid**
* **Roy (1982)**:
  * ABO blood group data revealed 39 **homogeneous superclusters**.
* **Majumdar et al. (1990)**:
  > “Indians cannot be classified into a fixed ethnic set using anthropometry alone.”
* **Bhalla (1992)**:
  * Blood group data suggests **4–5 serological groups** based on physical traits.

---

### **10. Limitations in Trait-Based Classification**

#### **Challenges**

* Using **single traits** leads to **misclassification**.
* Traits must be:
  * **Inherited**
  * **Well-distributed** for reliable population linkage

#### **Reliable Genetic Markers** (Bhalla, 1986)

* Provide better insight into **population relationships**.

---

### **11. Complexity of Indian Population Structure**

* India has a **long history of migration and ethnic mixing**.
* Caste + tribe coexistence = **mosaic distribution** of traits.
* Makes interpretation of observed patterns **highly complex**.

---

### **12. Useful Traits for Biological Variation Study**

#### **Somatometric Characters**

* Stature
* Cephalic Index
* Nasal Index
* Total Facial Index

#### **Serological Traits**

* A, B, R’(CDe), r(cde), M, P’, Fy”

#### **Biochemical Traits**

* Hp’, HbS & E, G-6-PD deficiency
* ESD’, AK’, PGM, P’

#### **Other Genetic Traits**

* Colour blindness
* PTC taste sensitivity

> *Note: List is not exhaustive; many traits lack regional distribution data.*

---

### **13. Regional Genetic Profiles**

#### **North-West Himalayas (J\&K, H.P., U.P. Hills)**

* Traits: Dolichocephalic, leptorrhine, leptoprosopic
* High: B, M, P’, R’, ADA’, G-6-PD deficiency
* Low: Non-taster gene (J\&K)

#### **North-East Himalayas**

* Traits: Short stature, mesocephalic, mesorrhine
* High: t, Hb.E, A, R’, Fy’, AK’
* Low: r, ADA’

#### **Central Himalayas (Sikkim)**

* High: A, O, Fy’, AK’

* Distinct from North-East Himalayan traits

#### **Western India**

* Rajasthan: Above medium stature, dolichocephalic
* Gujarat: Medium stature, mesocephalic, euryprosopic
* G-6-PD: 2.20% (Gujarat) to 12.26% (Rajasthan)
* High: B, r
* Low: P’

#### **Central India (M.P. & Maharashtra)**

---

### **14. Scheduled Castes**

* Often **resemble caste populations** of their region.
* Typically **below-medium or short** (e.g., M.P., Karnataka, Kerala)
* Similar regional variation in traits.
* Notable: **Moderately high sickle cell** and **G-6-PD deficiency** (esp. in Central region)

# **Linguistic Elements in India**

## **1. Endangered Languages: A Global and National Concern**

### **International Examples**

* **Taushiro language** (Amazon basin, Peru):
  * Only one speaker remains.
* **Resigaro language** (same region):
  * Similarly endangered.
* **Cultural pressure of Spanish** is leading to **homogenisation** of diverse linguistic traditions in these regions.

---

## **2. India’s Linguistic Diversity**

### **Mother Tongue Survey of India**

* **Home Ministry’s 2021–22 annual report** states:
  > “In order to preserve and the original flavour of each indigenous Mother Tongue, it has been planned to set up a web-archive at the National Informatics Centre (NIC).”

### **Census Data on Mother Tongues**

* **Analysis of 2011 linguistic census** (reported in 2018 by PTI):
  * **More than 19,500 languages or dialects** are spoken in India as mother tongues.

### **Policy Recommendation in Education**

* **National Curriculum Framework (NCF)** for foundational education (launched October 2022 by **Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan**) recommends:
  * **Mother tongue** should be the **primary medium of instruction** in schools for children up to eight years of age.
    *(Source: Indian Express, Nov 8, 2022)*

---

## **3. Institutional Definitions and Limitations**

### **Impact of Official Definitions**

* **GoI defines a language** as one marked by a **script**:
  * **Oral languages** are **not officially recognised**, leading to their **marginalisation**.
* **Official count** of Indian languages: **122**
* **People’s Linguistic Survey of India** count: **780** (plus **100 more** suspected to exist)
> The discrepancy arises as **GoI doesn’t recognise any language with fewer than 10,000 speakers**.

---

## **4. Historical Marginalisation of Languages**

### **Colonial Legacy**

* **Criminal Tribes Act, 1871** (rescinded in 1952):
  * **British India** labelled certain nomadic communities as **criminal by birth**.
  * Forced them to **suppress their cultural identity and language**.
> “A simple act of bureaucracy can often be a tool for genocide for a language or a dialect.”

---

## **5. The Role of Funding in Language Preservation**

### **Global Examples**

* **Germany**:
  * Spends **over \$6.7 billion** on regional language support.
* **Britain**:
  * After years of ignoring **Welsh**, now spends **\$201 million annually** on Welsh-language education and media.

---

## **6. Official Recognition and Oral Traditions**

### **Status of Endangered Languages in India**

* Out of **197 endangered languages**, only **Boro** and **Meithei** have **official status**.
  * Reason: They possess **writing systems**.
> “Such an Act forgets that most of our greatest scriptures and epics are part of an oral tradition, embodied into actual writing over centuries.”

### **Need for Reform**

* Recognition should be extended to **oral traditions**.
* Current frameworks **ignore cultural value** of **oral heritage**.

---

## **7. Institutional Efforts and Remaining Challenges**

### **Initiatives**

* **Central Institute of Indian Languages**:
  * Undertaken research and documentation.
  * Introduced the **‘Scheme for Protection and Preservation of Endangered Languages of India’**.

### **Challenges**

* **Limited outcomes** despite initiatives.
* **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** for Indian languages remains **primitive**.
* **Proofreading efforts** required for digitisation are **massive**.

---

## **8. Pathways Forward for Language Survival**

### **Educational Integration**

* **Schools teaching in endangered languages** help ensure their **survival** and **growth**.

### **Proposed National Project**

* **Large-scale digital project** (like *Project Tiger*) should be launched to:
  * **Preserve and document** endangered languages.
  * Include **audio-visual records** of:
    * Storytelling
    * Folk literature
    * Oral histories

### **Use of Open-Source Tools**

* **Cross-language open-source platforms** like:
  * **LinguaLibre**
  * **Kathabhidana**
  * **Pronounci**

> These tools can help build pronunciation libraries and enhance linguistic documentation.

### **Learning from Existing Initiatives**

* Models like **Global Language Hotspots** can be leveraged to:
  * **Guide efforts**
  * **Broaden reach** of language preservation work.

---

## **FAMILY REUNION**

*By Varun Gandhi, MP*
*Economic Times, June 1, 2018*

### **1. Reviving and Sustaining Indian Languages**

#### **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Language Preservation**

* The **2% CSR limit** should be **encouraged for use in**:
  * **Saving languages and crafts**
  * **Documenting** endangered languages
  * **Building accessibility tools**
* Resulting **databases** can be used for:
  * **Linguistic research**
  * **Linking related languages** (e.g., **Odia** with **Ho**, **Munda**, **Khadia**, and **Kui**)

#### **Community-Based Preservation**

* **Young speakers** should be engaged through:
  * **Spoken interactions**
  * **Language exchanges**
  * **Apps and podcasts**
* This approach has seen success in the **Tingit and Choctaw tribes** in the US.

---

### **2. Beyond Documentation: The Role of Daily Use**

> “But, ultimately, languages are not preserved by documentation but by having a profusion of people speaking them.”

#### **Need for Institutional and State Support**

* **Minimal support** for languages such as:
  * **Bhojpuri**
  * **Meithali** (Maharashtra)
  * **Sidi** (Gujarat)
  * **Majhi** (Sikkim)
* Their **revival** depends on:
  * **Livelihood support** for speakers
  * **Wider usage in daily life**

---

### **3. Linguistic Diversity as Cultural Wealth**

#### **Loss of Language = Loss of Cultural Universes**

> “When we lose a language, it is a loss of an entire universe including its cultural myths and rituals.”

* **Neglecting lesser-spoken languages** can also harm dominant ones:
  * **Hindi**, for example, is fed by **over 126 languages**.
  * Reducing this linguistic ecosystem weakens the **larger language** as well.

#### **Positive Trends and Digital Potential**

* **Bhil language** has seen **85% growth in speakers** over the last 20 years.
* There is **hope** through a **new social contract**:
  * **Preserve both orality and textual nature** of languages
  * Use **digital platforms** to do so

> “Such a practice would keep India’s purported pluralism alive, giving it renewal.”

---

### **4. Linguistic Identity and Social Integration**

#### **India’s Ethnic and Linguistic Diversity**

> “THE people of India display high degree of ethnic diversity that gets further diversified in the forms of speech of our people.”

* A **linguistic group** holds **social significance**.
* **Social integration** exists among speakers of the **same language**.

#### **Development in Isolation**

* **Languages and dialects** in India initially developed in:
  * **Geographic isolation**
* This gave rise to **regional identities** through language.

---

### **5. Linguistic Basis of State Formation**

> “IN FREE INDIA, the distribution on pattern of major language groups was considered as satisfactory basis for the formation of states.”

* Language became the **political foundation** for **state boundaries**.
* This added **political meaning** to the **geographical patterns** of linguistic distribution.

---

### **6. Census Data on Indian Languages**

#### **1961 Census Findings**

* **187 languages** were spoken by different sections of society.

> “This is, however, not surprising considering a large number of people inhabiting a vast land.”

#### **Language Distribution by Speaker Count**

* **94 of the 187 languages** are spoken by **less than 10,000 people** each.
* **23 languages** account for **97% of India’s total population**.
  * Of these, **15 languages (plus English)** are specified in the **Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India**.

## **Linguistic Regions of India**

The **geographical distribution of major languages** in India aligns broadly with identifiable **linguistic regions**. However, **tribal languages** follow a more complex and irregular pattern, often not conforming to this regional structure.

---

### **1. Concept of Linguistic Regions**

* The classification of linguistic regions is based on the **numerical strength** of speakers.
* Around **a dozen major languages** form the core of India’s linguistic regional structure.
* **Tribal languages**, however, do **not fit** into this organized scheme due to their fragmented and enclave-based distribution.

> “The tribal groups are concentrated in enclaves in central, eastern and north-eastern parts of the country. The regional mosaic of the tribal languages is highly complex and does not lend itself to a simplified scheme of regions.”

---

### **2. Major Linguistic Regions (Based on Principal Languages)**

These **twelve major languages** define the **principal linguistic regions**:

1. **Kashmiri**
2. **Punjabi**
3. **Hindi / Urdu**
4. **Bengali**
5. **Assamese**
6. **Oriya**
7. **Gujarati**
8. **Marathi**
9. **Kannada**
10. **Telugu**
11. **Tamil**
12. **Malayalam**

---

### **3. Distribution of Tribal Languages**

* **Tribal languages** often form **small clusters** or **overlap** with major language regions.
* In the **North-East**, certain tribal languages (e.g., those in **Arunachal Pradesh**) display **knife-edged boundaries**, with clear, sharp linguistic separation.

---

### **4. Relationship Between Linguistic and State Boundaries**

* The **twelve linguistic regions** generally align with **Indian states**, but not always.
* **State boundaries** do **not precisely match** **linguistic boundaries**.

> “The linguistic boundary in itself is not a line. It is a zone of transition over which one language gradually loses its dominance and gives way to the other.”

---

## **Unifying Influences**

While India exhibits significant **linguistic diversity**, it is important not to overlook the **strong forces of integration** that have historically worked across linguistic boundaries.

---

### **1. Role of Social Interaction and Common Vocabulary**

* Centuries of **social interaction** between different **linguistic groups** have contributed to the evolution of a **common all-India vocabulary**.
* This vocabulary has been shaped and enriched by multiple **historical languages of authority and administration**.

---

### **2. Major Integrative Languages in Indian History**

#### **a. Sanskrit**

* Played a **binding role** within:
  * The **Indo-Aryan language family**, and
  * Between **Indo-Aryan** and **Dravidian** language families.
* Functioned as a **classical language of religion, literature, and administration**.

#### **b. Persian**

* Gained prominence during the **medieval period**.
* Strongly influenced indigenous languages such as:
  * **Marathi**
  * **Kannada**
  * **Telugu**
  * **Tamil**
  * **Bengali**

#### **c. English**

* Has played a **similar unifying role** in **modern times**.
* Serves as a medium of instruction, administration, and inter-state communication.

---

### **3. Contribution of Hindi and Urdu**

* Both **Hindi** and **Urdu** have significantly contributed to **linguistic integration** in **recent history**.
* A key cultural example of this integration is found in the influence of **Hindustani cinema (film)**, which blends elements of both languages and reaches a pan-Indian audience.
