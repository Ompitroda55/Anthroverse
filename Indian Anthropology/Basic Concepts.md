# **Great and Little Traditions, Universalization and Parochialization**

### 1. **Understanding 'Tradition' in Anthropology**

* 'Tradition' refers to:
  * Patterns of beliefs
  * Customs
  * Values
  * Behaviours
  * Knowledge or expertise
* These are transmitted across generations through socialization within a given population.

### 2. **Redfield’s Contribution: Great vs Little Traditions**

* The terms **‘Great’** and **‘Little’** were introduced by **Robert Redfield** in his study of **Mexican peasant societies**.
* Definitions:

  * **Great Tradition**: Traditions of the **elite or reflective few**
    * Found in **sacred texts**
    * Codified and disseminated through **educational and urban centres**
  * **Little Tradition**: Traditions of the **masses or commoners**
    * Spread through **folk culture**

### 3. **Conceptual Framework**

* Central Concepts:
  * **Civilization**
  * **Social organization of tradition**
* Civilization develops through:
  * **Endogenetic factors** (internal growth)
  * **Exogenous contact** with other civilizations

### 4. **Interaction Between Traditions**

* Cultural systems change via:
  * **Orthogenetic processes** (internal differentiation)
  * **Heterogenetic processes** (external influences)
* The **direction of change** generally flows from:
  * Orthogenetic → Heterogenetic
  * Little Tradition → Great Tradition → Cross-cultural/Universal forms

---

## **Indian Context: Singer and Marriott's Views**

### 5. **Milton Singer on Indian Cultural Change**

* **Milton Singer**, a disciple of Redfield, observed:
  * Indian civilization is **endogenous**, growing from **pre-existing traditions**
  * The **Great Tradition** is continuous with **regional and local Little Traditions**
  * Cultural change is **absorbed** into the Indian ethos without major disruptions
* Quote:

  > "Its Great Tradition is continuous with various regional and local Little Traditions... Modernization and other factors of change are absorbed in the cultural ethos."

### 6. **McKim Marriott’s Elaboration**

* **McKim Marriott**, also a student of Redfield, studied **Kishan Garhi**
* He observed:
  * Traditions co-exist and **borrow elements** from each other

#### Key Concepts Introduced:

* **Universalization**:
  * Movement of **Little Tradition elements** into the **Great Tradition**
* **Parochialization**:
  * Movement of **Great Tradition elements** into the **Little Tradition**
  * Defined as:

    > “Process of limitation upon the scope of intelligibility, of deprivation of literary form, of reduction to less systematic and less reflective dimensions.”

* During **parochialization**, even the **structure or essence** of the Great Tradition may be **altered** and absorbed by the Little Tradition.

---

## **Examples from Kishan Garhi**

### 7. **Illustrative Cases by Marriott**

* **Parochialized forms**:
  * **Gobardhan Puja** ← from **Govardhan Puja** (mythological hill)
  * **Nauratha Puja** ← from **Sanskrit goddess**
* **Universalized form**:
  * **Lakshmi Puja** ← as a universalized version of **Saurti**

### 8. **Limitations and Ambiguity**

* Marriott cautions:
  > “We are ordinarily unable to trace the course of either process with certainty... Whether a given religious content is the result of universalization or parochialization cannot be definitively known.”
* Further examples:
  * **Festival of Lights** and **Charm Tying festival**
    * Homologies may be due to either universalization or parochialization
  * **Lakshmi and Saurti**: Either could have influenced the other
  * **Barley shoots and priestly charms**: The influence direction remains unclear
  * **Cow-Nourisher Worship** and **Nine Durgas**: No definitive guarantee of parochial movement

---

## **Critical Perspective and Indian Scholarly Reflection**

### 9. **Criticism of Foreign Anthropological Interpretations**

* Cited from **Nadeem Hasnain**’s *Indian Anthropology*:
  * Shock over foreign anthropologists' attempts to explain Indian cultural change **without basic knowledge** of Indian traditions
  * Marriott also seen as lacking depth in Indian cultural context

### 10. **Specific Critiques**

* **Phonetic similarity** issues:
  * Confusion between **Gobardhan** and **Govardhan**
* **Brahminical tradition** as traditional Great Tradition
  * Now challenged by emerging **secular elite traditions**
  * Today, identifying a **single Great Tradition** for all Indian society is nearly **impossible**

### 11. **Hindu Society vs Indian Society**

* Experts often equate **Indian society** with **Hindu society**
  * Leads to **identity confusion** in applying anthropological concepts

---

# **Sanskritization**

### 1. **Origins of the Concept: Brahminisation**

* **M.N. Srinivas**, while studying the **Coorgs**, observed:
  * **Lower castes** tried to improve their caste status by **imitating Brahmin customs**
  * This included:
    * **Giving up meat eating**
    * **Abandoning animal sacrifice**
    * **Avoiding liquor consumption**
    * **Adopting Brahminical rituals**
* Srinivas termed this process **‘Brahminisation’**, defined as:
  > "Imitation of higher caste values and ways by the lower castes with anticipation for a rise in caste hierarchy."

### 2. **Transition to ‘Sanskritization’**

* Srinivas later found that imitation was not limited to **Brahmins**, but extended to other **twice-born (dwija)** castes.
* Therefore, he replaced ‘Brahminisation’ with the broader term **Sanskritization**, to reflect:
  * Social change through imitation of any **higher caste** by the **lower caste**, in hopes of upward mobility.

---

## **Definition and Scope of Sanskritization**

### 3. **Contemporary Definition**

* Sanskritization is now defined as:
  > “A process by which a ‘low’ Hindu caste, or tribal or any other group, changes its customs, rituals, ideology and way of life in the direction of a high, frequently ‘twice-born’ caste. Generally such changes are followed by a claim to a higher position in the caste hierarchy than that traditionally assigned to the claimant caste by the local community.”
* According to Srinivas:
  > “Sanskritization means not only the adoption of new customs and habits, but also exposure to new ideas and values which have found frequent expression in the vast body of Sanskrit literature, sacred as well as secular. *(Karma, Dharma, Papa, Maya, Samsara and Moksa are examples of some of the most common Sanskritic theological ideas, and when people become Sanskritised, these words occur frequently in their talk.)*”

---

## **Dominant Caste and Local Influences**

### 4. **Adoption Based on Local Power Structures**

* **Srinivas introduced the concept of ‘dominant caste’** to explain:
  * Why lower castes imitate **specific** higher castes locally
  * Imitation is often directed at **locally influential** castes rather than just Brahmins

---

## **Criticism and Limitations**

### 5. **Ambiguity and Misunderstandings**

* **Phonetic confusion**: Term confuses laypeople due to similarity with **‘Sanskrit’** and **‘samsakriti’**
* **Selective imitation**:
  * Some groups imitate **ritual elements**
  * Others borrow **secular aspects**

### 6. **Historical and Contemporary Context**

* Sanskritization is more applicable to a **relatively closed Hindu society**
* In contemporary times:
  * **Revivalism** in lower castes
  * **Constitutional benefits**
  * Sanskritization is **not a dominant process** of social change anymore

---

## **Neglected Dimensions**

### 7. **Ignored Religious Influences**

* The concept **ignores contributions** of:
  * **Buddhism**
  * **Jainism**
  * **Islam**
* These traditions also played significant roles in **social change**

### 8. **Omission of Reverse Trends**

* The concept is **silent on de-Sanskritisation** or **tribalisation**
* **Structural changes** in Indian society cannot be explained through Sanskritization alone
* **Marriott** found in **Kishan Garhi**:
  * **Sanskritic elements added** to local customs
  * But without replacing **non-Sanskritic** elements

---

## **Comparative Evaluations**

### 9. **Yogendra Singh’s Comparative Analysis**

* He notes:
  > “The concepts of universalization and parochialization also describe the processes of cultural change implied by Sanskritization, especially universalization comes very close to the concept. Parochialization, however, refers to an inverted form of Sanskritization or de-Sanskritisation, a connotation which escaped the formulation of Srinivas.”
* On **Marriott’s limitations**:
  > “The contribution of Marriott is very limited in scope specially because he focussed merely upon the orthogenetic process of cultural change.”
* Strengths of **Redfield's Little and Great Traditions**:
  * Offers **broader comparative framework**
  * Covers both **heterogenetic and orthogenetic** sources of change
  * Incorporates what Srinivas called **westernization and Sanskritization**
  * Has a **tighter logical structure**
* Yet, even this approach:
  * Suffers from **culturological bias**
  * Neglects **structural aspects** of social change

---

## **Reference Group Theory**

### 10. **A Unifying Explanation**

* All culturological concepts, including Sanskritization, can be seen as **manifestations** of the broader:
  * **Reference Group concept**
* This concept explains:
  * Why **lower castes imitate higher castes** (because they are a **reference group**)
  * Applies also to:
    * Great and Little Traditions
    * Processes like **parochialization**

---

# **Westernization**

**\[M.N. Srinivas: A Note on Sanskritization and Westernization (Far Eastern Quarterly, 1956)]**

---

### 1. **Definition and Nature of the Concept**

* **Westernization**, compared to **Sanskritization**, is considered a **simpler concept**.
* **Defined by M.N. Srinivas** as:
  > “The changes brought over 150 years of British rule, the culture as a result of over 150 years of British rule, the culture subsuming changes occurring at different levels—technology, institutions, ideology and values.”
* Key dimensions of Westernization:
  * **Technology**
  * **Institutions**
  * **Ideology**
  * **Values**

* **Humanitarianism** and **rationalism** are emphasized values under Westernization.
* Outcomes of Westernization in India include:
  * Establishment of **scientific, technological and educational institutions**
  * Rise of **nationalism**
  * Development of **new political culture**
  * Emergence of **modern leadership**

---

### 2. **Conceptual Limitations and Terminological Issues**

* **Label Unsuitability**:
  * "Westernization" is seen as **too localized a label**.
  * It inaccurately centers around the **West** (especially **U.S.A.**), despite:
    * **Russia**, **Turkey**, **Japan**, and **India** undergoing parallel developments.
* As **Daniel Lerner** points out:
  > “Educated people in the Middle East, while wanting ‘the modern package’ reject the label made in U.S.A (or, for that matter, ‘made in U.S.S.R’).”
* **Preference for “Modernization”** over Westernization:
  * More neutral and applicable across societies
  * Avoids geographic or ideological bias

---

### 3. **Dual and Contradictory Outcomes**

* **Westernization** has led to **mutually opposing forces**:
  * **Printing technology**:
    * Spread of **modern knowledge**
    * Revival of **traditional epics**, **mythology**, **saints’ lives**, and **religious literature**
* **Political and cultural outcomes** include:
  * **Nationalism**
  * **Revivalism**
  * **Communalism**
  * **Casteism**
  * **Linguistic consciousness**
  * **Regionalism**
* **Revivalist movements** paradoxically used:
  * **Western-style institutions** (schools, colleges)
  * **Print media** (books, pamphlets, journals) to promote traditionalist ideas

---

### 4. **Relationship with Sanskritization**

* According to **Srinivas**:
  * **Westernization does not retard Sanskritization**.
  * Instead, both **coexist** and **mutually reinforce** one another.
* Example:
  * **Postal services, railways, buses, and newspapers** (outcomes of Western impact) enable:
    * More organized **religious pilgrimages**
    * **Caste meetings**
    * **Caste solidarities**

---

### 5. **Analytical Scope and Limitations**

* **Conceptual limitation**: Focuses on **cultural change**, not **structural change**
* **Srinivas acknowledges**:
  > “To describe the social changes occurring in modern India in terms of Sanskritization and Westernization is to describe it primarily in cultural and not in structural terms. An analysis in terms of culture is much more difficult than analysis in terms of ‘positional change’ in the caste system without involves ‘structural change’.”
* The twin concepts are essentially **‘truth asserting’**, not theory-building:
  * They risk becoming **vague** across different historical and cultural contexts

---

### 6. **Need for Conceptual Refinement**

* **Srinivas** admits:
  > “Sanskritization is an extremely complex and heterogeneous concept. It is even possible that it would be more profitable to treat it as a bundle of concepts than it is only a name for widespread cultural change.”
* Conclusion:
  * Though of **practical value**, **Sanskritization and Westernization** lack the precision needed for a **consistent theory of cultural change**

---

### 7. **Yogendra Singh’s Evaluation**

* Y. Singh's expert commentary is essential while discussing these concepts.
* He critiques them as:
  * **Theoretically loose**
  * **Empirically useful** for **truth-asserting descriptions** of cultural change

---

# **Sanskritization and Westernization**

### *(As theorized by M.N. Srinivas)*

---

### 1. **Theoretical Framework of Cultural Change**

* A **comprehensive theory** of social or cultural change acknowledges **sources of change** from both:
  * **Within the system** (internal)
  * **Outside the system** (external)
* **Srinivas’s twin concepts**:
  * **Sanskritization**: Internal cultural mobility
  * **Westernization**: Change through external cultural contact, particularly with **Great Britain**

---

### 2. **Sanskritization: Definition and Evolution**

#### **Definition by Srinivas**:

> “The process by which a ‘low’ caste or tribe or other group takes over the customs, rituals, beliefs, ideology and style of life of a high and, in particular, a ‘twice-born’ (dwija) caste. The Sanskritization of a group has usually the effect of improving its position in the local caste hierarchy.”

#### **Conditions for Sanskritization**:

* Improvement in **economic or political position**
* Rise in **group self-consciousness**
* Contact with **sources of the Great Tradition**:
  * **Pilgrim centres**
  * **Monasteries**
  * **Proselytizing sects**

#### **From Brahminization to Sanskritization**:

* Earlier termed **‘Brahminization’**: imitation of **Brahmin practices**
* Later broadened to **Sanskritization**:
  * Not limited to Brahmins
  * May involve **any higher caste model**, especially the **‘twice-born’**

> “Certain Vedic rites are confined to the Brahmins and the other ‘twice-born’ castes” — a basis for distinguishing Sanskritization from Brahminization.

---

### 3. **Debates and Interpretations of Sanskritization**

* The concept sparked **a major debate** in Indian sociology.
* Appealing to:
  * **Indologists**
  * **Historians of Indian culture**
  * **Sociologists and social anthropologists**
* Valued as a **native Indian concept** to analyze **Indian socio-cultural phenomena**

#### **Historical Contextualization**:

* Scholars explored **historical validation** and **limitations** of Sanskritization
* **Chanana’s critique** (in Punjab):
  * Cultural models for imitation included **Persian** elements
  * Regarding **Westernization**, Chanana notes:
    > “It would be better to say that to a large extent in externals and the reassertion of largely Indian values, mingled with the humanitarian values of the West spirit.”

---

### 4. **Alternative Views and Critiques**

* Some social scientists argue:
  * Sanskritization should be analyzed in relation to **socio-economic deprivations**
  * It may reflect:
    * **Ritual status-seeking** in lieu of economic mobility
    * Or as a consequence of economic changes

#### **Circular vs. Linear Model**:

* Imitation not always a linear upward borrowing
* **Mckim Marriott’s observation**:
  > “It is no clear process of Sanskritization ‘at the expense of’ the ‘non-Sanskritic’ traditions... Sanskritic rites are often added on to non-Sanskritic rites without replacing them.”

> “Evidence of accretion and of transmutation in cultural form without apparent replacement and without rationalization of the accumulated and transformed elements.”

---

### 5. **Conceptual Complexity**

* **Srinivas’s own view**:
  > “Sanskritization is an extremely complex and heterogeneous concept. It is even possible that it would be more profitable to treat it as a bundle of concepts than as a single concept.”
* Interpretations vary:
  * Social scientists have both **criticized** and **praised** it for **contradictory reasons**

#### **Examples of Interpretative Diversity**:

* **Edward B. Harper**:
  * Sees Sanskritization as a **functional concept** (not historical)
  * A tool to understand **changing relationships within tradition**
* **J.F. Staal**:
  > “Sanskritization describes a process and is a concept of change. It is not a concept at which the synchronic analysis could ever arrive... All historical concepts are meta-concepts based upon concepts of synchronic analysis.”
* Sanskritization thus appears as a **historical meta-concept**.

---

### 6. **Positional vs. Structural Change**

* **Sanskritization** captures **cultural/positional** changes
* Does **not** directly account for **structural change**
* It assumes **structural constraints** exist within the **social system**

#### **Link with Dominant Caste**:

* Related to Srinivas’s concept of **‘dominant caste’**
  * Defined by **ritual hierarchy** and **four variables of dominance**
  * **Critically examined** by other social scientists
  * Despite complexity, this idea **adds dynamism** to Sanskritization

> “It is the dominant castes or groups that offer themselves as models for Sanskritization by the groups lower in hierarchy.”

* **Cultural mobility** is seen as a **function of power**

---

### 7. **Westernization and Secularization**

* **Westernization**:
  * Involves **cultural and institutional innovations** due to **contact with the West**
  * Primarily stems from contact with the **U.K.**
* **Secularization**:
  * A **counterpart of Westernization**
  * Emerged as a **national ideology** post-Independence
  * Emphasizes:
    * **Religious and cultural tolerance**
    * **Group coexistence**
    * **Legislative and constitutional provisions** supporting secular values

> Srinivas uses **three core concepts**—**Sanskritization**, **Westernization**, and **Secularization**—to explain the **major processes of social change** in India.

---

# **Little and Great Traditions**

## **1. Conceptual Foundations: Redfield’s Framework**

* Robert Redfield’s studies in Mexico laid the foundation for analyzing social change through traditions.
* He proposed analyzing civilizations at different **cultural and social organizational levels**.
* Each civilization comprises two traditions:
  * **Great Tradition**: Associated with the elite or reflective few, where culture is formally articulated.
  * **Little Tradition**: Pertains to the folk, peasants, or unlettered population.

> “Each tradition has its own social organization, that is, institutionalized roles, statuses, and personnel. Both traditions taken together symbolise a world view which represents the unity of civilization.”

## **2. Processes of Change in Traditions**

* Traditions evolve through two key processes:
  * **Orthogenetic Process**: Internal, creative, organic development.
  * **Heterogenetic Process**: Change through external influences (e.g., war, contact, communication, migration).
* According to Redfield:
  > “All civilizations begin with orthogenetic or primary process of growth and keep on transforming themselves through heterogenetic contacts.”

---

## **3. Application to Indian Society**

### **Milton Singer’s Adaptation**

Singer applied Redfield’s model to Indian social change, emphasizing **cultural continuity** between the Great and Little Traditions:

> “(1) that because India has a ‘primary’ or indigenous’ civilization... its ‘Great Tradition’ was continuous with the ‘Little Tradition’...
> (2) That this cultural continuity was the product... of a common cultural consciousness...
> (3) That this common cultural consciousness... \[was formed] with the help of... sacred books and sacred objects...
> (4) That... acceptance of ‘modernizing’ and ‘progress’ ideologies... may result in the ‘traditionalizing’ of apparently ‘modern’ innovations.”

* Conclusion: Indian society exhibits **resilience through selective adaptation**, not through basic transformation.

### **Mckim Marriott’s Contribution**

* Introduced the concepts of:
  * **Parochialization**: Downward diffusion of Great Tradition into the Little Tradition, with elements losing their original form.
  * **Universalization**: Upward movement of Little Tradition elements into the Great Tradition, where they are legitimized.
* He notes:
  > “Sanskritization does not proceed as an independent process... it is superimposed on non-Sanskritic cultural forms through accretion rather than simple replacement.”

---

## **4. Critiques of the Little–Great Tradition Framework**

### **S.C. Dube’s Criticism**

* Points out the insufficiency of bipolar classification in India’s **multipolar traditional system**:

> “Where there are more than one Great Traditions, each with its canonical texts and ethical codes, the situation becomes all the more confusing…”

* Proposes a **six-fold classification**:
  * Classical tradition
  * Emergent national tradition
  * Regional tradition
  * Western tradition
  * Local sub-cultural traditions
  * Tribal tradition

### **Limitations of the Above Approaches**

* No clear **criteria** for defining traditions.
* Focus remains mostly on **cultural change**, neglecting **structural transformations**.
* Variables used are largely **culturological**, dealing with ideologies and outlooks, not the structure of the social system.
* The approach shares limitations with Srinivas and Singer.

---

## **5. Structural vs. Cultural Change**

* Most conceptual frameworks fail to address **structural changes** or transformations in **social stratification principles**.
* Example: Even **Sanskritization-Westernization** focuses only on a **limited segment** of reality.

> “The dependent and independent variables used do not reach point of critical minima to be considered adequate for theoretical generalizations.”

---

## **6. Critical Evaluation of Sanskritization**

### **S.C. Dube’s Observations**

> “The Sanskritization hypothesis has served its limited purpose well... but... it is found wanting in many respects.”

* Critiques:
  * Multiple **Sanskritic Models** exist, not a single uniform one.
  * **Wide variation** in ideals within Hindu philosophy.
  * Regional and historical contexts influence model selection.
* Non-Sanskritic inspiration:
  > “Followers of Buddha, Kabir, Raidas, Dabu or Jyotiba Phule... draw their inspiration... not in Sanskrit... often they consciously reject central ideas of the Sanskritic Model.”

* Suggestion: Use term **"Classical Models"** instead of Sanskritic Model for better inclusivity.

### **Key Points of Critique**

1. **Vagueness of the Sanskritic Model**:
   * Operationally insignificant; better seen as multiple models.
2. **Non-Sanskritic Sources of Models**:
   * Many religious and social groups follow non-Sanskritic mentors and ideologies.
3. **Multiple Reference Models**:
   * Cultural processes are **multi-directional**.
   * **Secular trends** are just as important as ritual ones.

> “The Brahmin does not provide a model to everyone and for everything…”

---

## **7. Other Models: Kulin and Rajputization**

* **Kulin Model (Narmadeshwar Prasad, 1957)**: Combines ritual and secular elements.
* **Kshatriyaization/Rajputization**:
  * Emphasized by S.K. Srivastava and G.S. Bhatt.
  * Found more significant than Sanskritization in some regions like Uttar Pradesh.

---

## **8. Conclusion and Theoretical Challenges**

* **No precise definition** exists for Great or Little Traditions.
* **Canonical texts** are inconsistent and often contradictory.
* Difficulty arises in:
  * Identifying transformed elements.
  * Accounting for secular and alien influences.
  * Reconciling regional variations.

> “The way out appears to lie in adopting a more complex framework of traditions, when viewed together, would reflect more truly the contemporary cultural processes in India.”

### **Requirements for a Better Framework**

* Must account for:
  * Historical antecedents
  * Regional variations
  * Multiple reference groups and divergent pulls
  * Integration of both **ritual** and **secular** trends

---

# **Sanskritization and Jati Mobility**

## 1. **Definition and Mechanism**

* **Sanskritization** refers to efforts made by lower castes to emulate the Brahmin style of life.
* Tactics include:
  * Adoption of Sanskrit rituals.
  * Hiring Brahmin priests.
  * Abandoning "defiling" occupations.
    * E.g., Chamars (leather workers) ceased working with leather.
    * Balais in Rajasthan stopped making shoes.
  * Changing dietary habits:
    * Khatiks near Benares stopped keeping pigs.
    * Adoption of vegetarianism or less defiling food.
  * Giving up liquor and widow remarriage.

> “Claims to ‘twice-born’ varna status, along with the justifications for such claims, were made in the process of Sanskritization.”

* Today, no official arbiter exists for caste status in secular India, but **public opinion** serves as an informal mechanism of arbitration.

## 2. **Broadening of Sanskritization**

* **M.N. Srinivas** later expanded Sanskritization to include emulation of any high varna dominant caste.
* **Elite Emulation** (term by Lynch):
  * “Right-hand” castes in Kongu (Tamil Nadu) emulate dominant cultivators.
  * “Left-hand” castes emulate Brahmins (Beck 1972).
* **Bernett** discussed emulation of both Brahmin and **Kingly models** (1970).

## 3. **"Pulling Rank" Tactic**

* Upwardly mobile jatis may **refuse food/water** from slightly higher-ranking jatis:
  * Sweepers of Khalapur tried to avoid food at Leather workers’ weddings.
  * Considered rejecting service to Laundrymen (higher ranked Shudras).

## 4. **Limits and Exceptions**

* **Srinivas (1962: 58):** Untouchables cannot cross into Shudra status.
* **Exceptions exist:**
  * Laundrymen in western Uttar Pradesh are untouchables.
  * In eastern Uttar Pradesh, they are considered Shudras.

## 5. **Economic and Political Reinforcement**

* Sanskritization succeeds best with **economic or political backing**.

### Example: Noniyas of Eastern Uttar Pradesh

* Traditional occupation: salt making and earth moving.
* Economic mobility through government contracts in 19th century.
* Formation of **Rajput Advancement Society** to claim **Chauhan Rajput** status.
* Actions included:
  * Sacred thread initiation.
  * Literature asserting descent from King Prithvi Raj.
* **William Rowe's study of Senapur:**
  * Over 50 years, Noniyas rose from near-untouchable to upper Shudra.
  * Adopted Brahmin priests, vegetarian goddess, parda system.
  * Faced opposition from dominant Thakur caste.

### Example: Kanbis of Gujarat (David Pocock)

* Benefited from **British favour**.
* Changed caste name to **Patidars** in 1931.
* Equalized rank with **Vaishyas**.

## 6. **Internal Division and Proliferation of Jatis**

* Sanskritization often splits jatis:
  * Sanskritized segment “pulls rank” by refusing marriage with less Sanskritized segment.
* This causes **proliferation of jati units**.
* Result: Stability in caste system through fragmentation.

> “Hindu society is not composed of a small aristocracy and a large mass.”

* Rankings exist even within the **twice-born**.
* Among Shudras and untouchables, **purity-pollution axis** defines rank.
* These distinctions:
  * Prevent unity among the masses and aristocracy.
  * Deter joint efforts against the caste system.

## 7. **Modern Trends: Fusion in Non-Pollution Contexts**

* In modern contexts where **pollution concepts** are weak, **fusion** of contiguous castes is more likely.

---

# **The Effect of Education on Caste**

* **Access to modern education** is a key precondition for Sanskritization.
* Reform movements and Christian missions:
  * **Arya Samaj** and **Brahmo Samaj** established schools for lower castes.
* **Jatavs (Lynch’s study):**
  * Sent boys to Christian, Arya Samaj, and government schools.

### Example: Jatavs of Agra

* Early 20th century: Influenced by Arya Samaj, claimed **Kshatriya varna**.
* Organized Sanskritization efforts.
* 1930s: Aligned with **Ambedkar**, identified as **Scheduled Caste**.
* 1950s: Converted to **Buddhism**.
* 1958: Formed **Republican Party of Agra** to gain political power.

> The Jatavs transitioned from Sanskritization (within caste system) to **politicalization** (challenging the caste system).

---

# **Wealth and Caste Mobility**

* Wealth (especially **land ownership**) helps a jati adopt elite lifestyles.

### Examples:

* **Kunbis in Maharashtra** became **Marathas** (Ghurye).
* **Mercenary soldiers** in Tanjore:
  * Acquired land.
  * Adopted customs of higher castes.
  * Became **Vellalas**.

> “Maravans, and Agamudaiyans, becoming fat, turn into Vellalas” (local saying).

---

# **Rank Within a Caste**

* Caste groups may be **loosely structured** (Henry Orenstein):
  * E.g., **Marathas**, **Kolis**.
* **Marathas:** Include all high Hindu castes except vegetarians (Brahmins, Gurava, Sonars).
* **Kolis:** Shudra castes below Marathas but above untouchables.

### Internal Hierarchies:

* **Navars (Kerala):**
  * Royal lineages, headmen lineages, commoner lineages.
* **Kallas of Tanjore** also exhibit internal rank variation.
* Hierarchies arise from:
  * Successful conquest.
  * Title acquisition.
  * Modern education and professional entry.

> See Robert Hardgrave's study on **Nadars**, toddy-tappers of Tamilnadu (1969).

---

# **Geographic Mobility and Identity Claims**

* **Adrian Mayer**: Some jati segments migrate and claim higher rank.
* However, local communities often **reject such claims** due to identity doubts.

> Example: A jati claiming Brahminhood was denied food-sharing rights.

---

# **Downward Mobility in the Caste System**

### Mechanisms:

1. **Conquest**: Loss of power leads to rank decline.
2. **Outcasting**:
   * **Louis Dumont**: Segment of **Pramalai Kallar** excluded due to descent from “irregular unions”.

> Supports classical theory that caste proliferation results from inter-varna marriages.

---

# **Constraints on Caste Passing**

* **Social support systems** (family, kinship) make permanent passing rare.
* **Harold Isaacs**: Educated untouchables may appear higher caste, but familial needs discourage long-term disguise.

---

# **Renunciation as Escape**

* **Holy men** could exit caste system:
  * Total severance from family and caste.
  * Seen as individualistic **escape-hatch** (Dumont).
* Female renouncers are rare and usually elderly.

---

# **Tribe-Caste Continuum**

## 1. **Origin of the Continuum Concept**

* The concept of **continuum** was introduced by **Robert Redfield** during his study of Mexican villages to capture the full spectrum of rural and urban life.
* Redfield proposed the **Folk-Urban Continuum**, characterizing:
  * Rural life as **good**, **happy**, and **integrated**.
  * Urban life as **atomistic**, **disorganized**, and **bad**.

> Oscar Lewis critiqued Redfield’s continuum as “simplistic, overly romantic, atemporal, and static.”

* The model was subsequently **modified by Wirth and Sjoberg**.
* The continuum concept has since gained traction among social analysts.

---

## 2. **Application to Indian Society**

* Scholars have attempted to apply the **continuum model** to understand the **tribe-caste continuum in India**.
* Even the most isolated tribal and caste groups in India share **cultural traits**, such as:
  * Concepts of **ritual purity and pollution**.
  * **Worship of local spirits**.
  * Certain **kinship practices**.

---

## 3. **Scholarly Perspectives**

* **Majumdar**, **Atal**, **Dube**, **Roy Burman**, **Risley**, and **Vidyarthi** have outlined **broad distinctions** between **Tribe** and **Jati** based on:
  * **Social**
  * **Political**
  * **Economic**
  * **Ritual**
  * **Psychological** factors.

> Despite these distinctions, they acknowledge that some tribal groups are closer to the jati side of the scale, and vice versa.

---

## 4. **Key Differences Between Tribe and Caste**

### A. **Social Factors**

* **Tribe**:
  * Interpersonal relations are **kinship-based**.
  * **Agnatic bands** (patrilineal) form primary social webs.
  * **Affinal ties** are of lesser importance.
  * **Lineage and clan** serve as corporate units for:
    * Land ownership
    * Defence
    * Economic activities
  * **Scavengers (untouchables)** may be attached but are not seen as integral.
* **Caste (Jati)**:
  * Especially in higher ranks, kinship **does not cover all of society**.
  * Support **inequality and hierarchical dependency**.
  * Unlike tribal societies, caste groups maintain **endogamy** and **ritual equality** within the jati.

> Caste and tribe are similar in being **endogamous units** composed of **ritual equals**.

---

### B. **Political Factors**

* **Tribe**:
  * Lack strong and complex political formations.
  * Do not generally have **specialized roles** or **dominant-subordinate** relationships.
  * Historically under kings, but seldom **subservient** or **faithful** subjects.
  * Characterized by the **land-clan nexus**.
  * **Segmentary society**: each segment is seen as **autonomous**.
* **Caste**:
  * Faster incorporation of **new groups**.
  * More **organic** than segmentary in structure.

---

### C. **Economic Factors**

* According to **Fernandez**:
  * The primary difference lies in **economic values**, not agricultural technology.
  * **Tribes** are:
    * Generally **shifting cultivators**.
    * Some are **hunter-gatherers**.
* **Sachchidanand**:
  * Tribes place **little value** on:
    * **Surplus accumulation**
    * **Use of capital**
    * **Marketing and trading**

---

### D. **Ritual Factors**

* **Tribal religion**:
  * Lacks access to **scriptures**.
  * Is **less systematized**, **less specialized**, and **less elaborate**.
  * Still influenced by **scriptural Hinduism**.
  * Emphasizes **short-term transcendental functions**.
  * **No sharp differentiation** between sacred and profane.
  * **Asceticism** is respected but not supreme.
  * **Puritanical conduct** is not a focus for afterlife benefits.
* **Caste religion**:
  * More **scriptural**, **systematized**, and **puritanical**.
  * Greater concern with **ritual conduct** for a better afterlife.

---

### E. **Psychological Factors**

* **Tribal people**:
  * Derive **direct satisfaction** from sensory pleasures:
    * Food
    * Drinks
    * Sex
    * Singing
    * Dancing
* **Twice-born (Dvija)**:
  * Show **ambivalence** toward such pleasures.
  * Enclose them within **elaborate rituals**.
  * **Kshatriya men** (not women) have some latitude for enjoyment but less than tribals.

---

## 5. **Historical and Contemporary Dynamics**

* Until the **19th century**, most tribal groups had minimal contact with:
  * **Caste villages**
  * **Centers of civilization**
* **Linguistic isolation** also characterized many tribes.
* Post-contact developments:
  * Some tribes **resisted integration** into caste society.
  * Others now **exist in name only** as tribes.
  * Even the **most remote tribes** show **civilizational cultural traits**.
  * The **most sophisticated castes** still function like a **putative kin-group**, akin to a tribe.

---

# **Dominant Caste**

## 1. **Introduction of the Concept**

* The concept of **Dominant Caste** was first introduced by **M.N. Srinivas** in his article:
  > *“Dominant Caste in Rampura”*, published in *American Anthropologist* (1959).
* Further elaborated in:
  > *Social Change in Modern India* (1972).

---

## 2. **Criteria for Dominance**

According to **M.N. Srinivas**, a caste is considered **dominant** when it possesses the following attributes:

* **Ownership of sizable arable land** locally available.
* **Numerical strength** in the village population.
* **High status** in the local caste hierarchy.

> “When a caste has all the attributes of dominance, it may be said to enjoy *decisive dominance*.”

* There may be **more than one dominant caste** in a village.
* **Over time**, dominance can shift from one caste to another.

---

## 3. **Evolving Factors of Dominance**

### A. **Modern Influences**

In the last **eight to nine decades**, new factors have contributed to caste dominance:

* **Western education**
* **Jobs in administration**
* **Urban sources of income**

These factors significantly enhance the **prestige and power** of particular caste groups in villages.

### B. **Post-Independence Political Changes**

* **Adult franchise** and **Panchayati Raj** have empowered **lower castes**, particularly:
  * **Harijans**, who now enjoy **reservations** in all elected bodies from the **village level to the Union Parliament**.

---

## 4. **Local vs. Regional Dominance**

* Dominance is **no longer purely local**:
  * A caste group with **few local families** may still wield power due to **regional dominance** and **networks of kinship ties**.
  * Conversely, a caste dominant in only one village must **reckon with** castes enjoying **regional dominance**.

---

## 5. **Land Ownership and Social Structure**

### A. **Land as a Basis of Dominance**

* **Land ownership** is a **crucial determinant** of dominance in rural India.
* Land is **concentrated** in the hands of **a few large owners**, while the majority are:
  * **Small landholders** or
  * **Landless labourers**

> The Indian situation is unique because **owners, tenants, labourers, artisans**, and **service providers** belong to **permanent and hereditary caste groups**.

### B. **Hierarchy of Labour and Ownership**

* Generally:
  * **Landowners** belong to **higher castes**
  * **Landless labourers** belong to **the lowest strata** of society

---

## 6. **Power, Prestige, and Caste Relations**

* The **power and prestige** of land-owning castes influence their **relationships with other castes**, including those **ritually higher**.

#### Examples:

* In **Punjab**, **Jats** view **Brahmins** as their **servants**.
* In **Madhopur (U.P.)**, **dominant Thakurs** accept **cooked food only from their own Gurus**, not from other Brahmins.
* In **Senapur and Rampur**, **Brahmins** were **neither powerful nor economically superior**, and were **subordinate to Jats and Thakurs**.

---

## 7. **Cultural Influence and Emulation**

* Dominant castes stimulate **aspiration and imitation** among **lower castes**, who seek to adopt the **prestigious lifestyle** of the dominant caste.
* In many rural areas:
  * **Landowning peasant castes** enjoy **decisive or shared dominance**.
  * These castes may come from **Shudra**, **Kshatriya**, or **Brahmin** categories.

---

## 8. **Role in Social Life and Value Transmission**

* **Elders** of the dominant caste act as **guardians** of a **pluralistic culture and value system** in traditional villages.

* Their influence permeates all areas of social life, even fundamental aspects like:
  * **Descent systems**
  * **Group affiliations**

#### Example:

> “The two patrilineal Tamil trading castes – **Tarakan** and **Mannadiyars** – gradually changed from patriliny to **matriliny** due to the impact of surrounding matrilineal societies.”

---

## 9. **Sanskritization Models and Dominant Castes**

* Each **locally dominant caste** interprets **Sanskritization** through its own cultural lens:

  | Dominant Caste Type | Transmitted Sanskritization Model |
  | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
  | Brahmin             | Brahminical model                 |
  | Rajput              | Kshatriya model                   |
  | Bania               | Vaishya model                     |

> “If the local dominant caste is Brahmin, it will transmit Brahminical model of Sanskritization; whereas if it is Rajput or Bania, it will transmit Kshatriya or Vaishya model respectively.”

---

# **Nature-Man-Spirit Complex**

## 1. **Introduction to the Concept**

* The concept of **Nature-Man-Spirit Complex** was developed by **L.P. Vidyarthi** in his book:
  > *The Maler* (1963)
* According to Vidyarthi, the complex comprises three interrelated components:
  * **Nature** (e.g., forest economy, *Khallu* or shifting cultivation)
  * **Man** (e.g., social organization, family life, lineage)
  * **Spirit** (e.g., worship of *Gossaiyan*)

* The concept proposes that **man is the focal point** in an interacting and counteracting relationship with both **Nature** and **Spirit**.

> "Man, in the above sense, revolves round the ecological set-up (i.e., Nature) and these two major interacting elements are affected, directly or indirectly, by Spirits."

---

## 2. **Interconnectedness of Elements**

* In **primitive and simpler societies**, all aspects of life—including subsistence, rituals, and beliefs—are interconnected.

> “Each and every activity of Spirits. Thus isolation of any one of them i.e. Nature or Man or Spirit is not possible as the mere survival of man depends on Nature and/or Spirit.”

---

## 3. **Case Study: The Maler of Rajmahal Hills**

Vidyarthi applies this concept to the **Maler tribe** of **Rajmahal Hills**, **Santal Pargana**, Bihar.

### Key Observations:

1. **Adaptation to Forest Economy**
   * The Maler are deeply integrated with the forest:
     * Consume roots, leaves, fruits, and game.
     * Have historically **escaped famines** in the plains due to the availability of **jungle products**.
2. **Economic Life and Rituals**
   * Practice **slash-and-burn cultivation** (*Khallu*), with **maize** as their staple.
   * Maize is central to their:
     * Economy
     * Ritual calendar
     * Moral values
   > “The good man, the moral man is he who grows maize by the khallu method.”
3. **Spirits and Worship**
   * Worship **Gossaiyans**, spirits believed to reside in and around the village hills.
   * Some spirits require **animal sacrifices** (calves, cows, buffaloes), in contrast to plain-dwellers.
4. **Cultural Identity and Social Life**
   * The **forest habitat** sustains their **distinct social norms**, including sexual behaviour.
5. **Use of Forest Resources**
   * Forests enable the **brewing of mahua**, which is plentiful and significant to their lifestyle.
6. **Historical Separation from Santal Villages**
   * Prefer to live **away from Santals** in the plains due to:
     * Historical experiences of **animosity, avoidance, and aggression**.
7. **Distrust of Government Schemes**
   * Maler view government initiatives with **suspicion**, rooted in:
     * Exploitation during **British rule**
     * Rising **bribery and corruption**
     * Lack of **consultation or cooperation**
   * Common beliefs among Maler:
     * Schools are for taking young ones to war.
     * Grain stores are to **entrap** them.
     * Schemes aim to **displace** them and **acquire hill property**.

---

## 4. **Conclusion**

* The **Maler lifestyle** is deeply shaped by their **ecological environment** and **cultural experiences**.
* They have evolved a distinct **Nature-Man-Spirit Complex** that they are **unwilling to abandon** under current circumstances.

---

## 5. **Scholarly Endorsement**

> In the words of **Julian H. Steward**:
>
> *“A monograph less rich in a sense of problem and less incisive in relevant detail would not pay Professor Vidyarthi the highest compliment I can pay. Vidyarthi is that ‘His analysis is so provocative even though its substantive reporting is not vitiated by excessive theorizing or imposition of preconceived notions upon the data.’”*

Here is a reorganized, reader-friendly version of the provided anthropology text on the **Sacred Complex**, with key terms highlighted and logical flow improved through structured headings and bullet points:

---

## **SACRED COMPLEX**

### Conceptual Framework

* **Civilization** is defined by Redfield as a complex of **Great and Little Traditions**.
* Inspired by this approach, the **Chicago School of Anthropologists**, along with Indian scholars, studied Indian civilization across **tribal, rural, and urban** contexts.

### Contributions to the Study of Little Traditions

* **Sinha (1957)** – Bhumij
* **Chauhan (1966)** – Bhils
* **Vidyarthi (1965)** – Munda
* **Edward Jay (1970)** – Maria Gond

These studies explore how isolated tribal cultures contribute to the **Little Traditions** of Indian civilization.

* The concept of **“unity and extension”** was proposed along with **Sanskritization**, **Hinduization**, and **Brahminization** to explain cultural linkages across Indian society.

---

## **The Sacred Complex of Gaya** (Vidyarthi, 1961)

A sacred complex is comprised of three interrelated components:

1. **Sacred Geography**
2. **Sacred Performances**
3. **Sacred Specialists**

---

### 1. Sacred Geography

* Gaya’s sacred geography includes numerous sacred objects and places located within the **‘Gaya Kshetra’**, a sacred zone.
* This sacred area can be subdivided into:
  * **Zones**
  * **Segments**
  * **Clusters of centres**

#### Characteristics:

* Centres may be:
  * **Temples**, **trees**, **natural shrines**, or **bathing places**
  * Shared between **Hindus and Buddhists**
* Scope of social contact:
  * Local
  * Regional
  * All-India pilgrim connections
* Importance varies with **festivals**, **ceremonies**, and **historical change**.
* Demonstrates **syncretism** between **Hindu and Buddhist traditions**.

> "Redfield both demonstrates the continuity of India’s Great and Little Traditions, and the processes of compromise and combination operating between them."

#### Modern Trends:

* The **secular zone** is expanding (population, area, resources).
* The **sacred zone** is declining (temples in ruin, replaced by secular monuments).

---

### 2. Sacred Performances

* Linked closely to sacred centres, the performances include:
  * **Floral offerings**
  * **Meditational exercises**
  * **Oblation libations**
  * **Artistic performances**
  * **Religious donations**

#### Key Ritual:

* **Gaya Shraddha** – a ritual sacrifice for **ancestral spirits**
  * Unique to Gaya and elaborated from broader Indian traditions.

> "Rules of Shraddha found in certain ancient texts (Vishnu Sutra, Vayu Purana, Manu Smriti) offer some evidence as to how ritual practices... have received universal recognition..."

These texts demonstrate how **folk and peasant rituals** integrate into the **pan-Hindu** framework through **textual mediation**.

---

### 3. Sacred Specialists

* Serve both the **sacred centres** and the **pilgrims (Yajman)**.
* Central group: **Gayawal caste** (Brahmin priests)

#### Features:

* Hold **monopoly** over **Gaya Shraddha**
* Live according to a **Sanskritic** style
* Have:
  * Complex **internal organization**
  * Broad **external networks**

#### Functional Roles:

1. **Disciples** of spiritual preceptors
2. **Priests** for patrons
3. **Masters** over ritual/domestic servants
4. **Partners** with non-Brahmin priests
5. **Shrine priests** at sacred centres

---

#### Subcultural Phases of Gayawal Priesthood

1. **Sanskritic Phase**
   * Orthodox, ceremonial
2. **Feudalistic Phase**
   * Wealthy, aristocratic, employs servants
3. **Proletarian Phase**
   * Commercial, mercenary, disorganized
4. **Folk Priest Phase** *(earlier conjecture)*
   * Traits still visible today

> "All four aspects... continue, of course, to exist among the Gayawal of today... each earlier variety of priesthood persisted alongside each later type..."

These phases reflect the **historical transformation** of Indian civilization, influenced by **Westernization**, **education**, and **mass communication**.

---

### The Sacred Complex as a Whole

* The **Gaya sacred complex** is:
  * A **local configuration** of sacred centres, performances, and specialists.
  * In **interdependence** with **Hindu civilization**.

#### Characteristics:

* Predominantly **Great Traditional** in content.
* **Incorporates and transforms** elements from **Little Traditions**.
* Acts as a **civilizational integrator**:
  * Connects **castes, sects, classes, statuses**.
  * Communicates with pan-India through **texts** and **priestly networks**.

---

### Broader Implications and Future Directions

> “Dr. L.P. Vidyarthi has done a good piece of original work... the study of cities and centres of culture... the process of ‘secondary urbanization’...”
> — **Prof. D.N. Majumdar**
* Encourages studies of **urban complexes** and **secondary urbanization**.
* Promotes **regional approaches** to studying civilization.

---

### The Concept of Civilizational Region (as per Jha)

* **Civilizational Region** = intermediate between a **village/town** and the **civilization unit**.
* It is of:
  * **Historic depth**
  * **Territorial spread**

#### Sacred Geography & Ritual Significance

* Forms a network of sacred places within ancient kingdoms.
* Examples:
  * **Mithila (Janakpur)** – mentioned in *Satapatha Brahmana*, *Brihad Vishnupurana*, *Vayupurana*.
  * **Mahakaushal (Ratanpur)** – mentioned in *Skandapurana*, *Jaiminipurana*.

Despite modernization, these regions continue to reflect:

* **Continuity of Great Tradition**
* **Persistent cultural styles**

---

### Conclusion

* An **anthropological approach** to civilization, particularly through the **Sacred Complex**, has advanced significantly.
* It provides valuable insight into:
  * The **structure**
  * The **processes**
  * The **integration** of Hindu civilization across time and space.
