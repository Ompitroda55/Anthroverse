# Diffusionism

## Overview of **Diffusionism**

During the 20th century, several **Schools of thought** emerged in Britain, America, and Germany that positioned themselves as **anti-evolutionist**. These schools were particularly critical of the concept of **Psychic Unity**. Instead, they proposed that:

* **Man** was inherently inventive, leading to significant inventions originating in specific locations.
* These inventions then spread globally through **diffusion** or **migration**.

### Key Concepts: **Diffusion** vs. **Migration**

The distinction between **diffusion** and **migration** is critical, as they represent distinct processes of **cultural change**:

* **Diffusion**: The process where cultural traits are adopted through imitation by one society from another.
* **Migration**: Involves the physical movement of people from their original settlements to new areas, carrying their **cultural inventory** but adapting it to new **environmental conditions**.

> Cultural diffusion is a process by which **culture traits**, discovered or invented at one place or society, are spread directly or indirectly to other society or places.

Although tracing the exact origin of a specific **cultural trait** is challenging, the spread of a trait through **diffusion** can often be reliably traced.

## Characteristics and Conditions of **Cultural Diffusion**

**Diffusionists** have outlined specific conditions and characteristics that govern the process of **cultural diffusion**:

1. **Adoption Based on Utility**:
   * A **cultural group** will adopt a **culture trait** from another group only if it is **meaningful and useful**—either economically, socially, or both.
2. **Impact on Cultural Change**:
   * The process of **diffusion** can lead to **culture change** in the adopting group.
   * Some borrowed **cultural traits** assimilate easily, while others may trigger significant changes within the adopting group.
3. **Adaptation to Environmental Conditions**:
   * During **diffusion**, **cultural traits** may not retain their **original form** due to varying **environmental conditions** in the adopting society.

## British School of Diffusionism

### Overview of the **British School**

The **British School of Diffusion**, also known as the **Pan-Egyptian School**, was founded by **Elliot Smith**, with **W.J. Perry** as his prominent follower. This school is characterized by its extreme views on **diffusion**, earning its proponents the label of **extreme diffusionists**.

### Key Beliefs

* **Egypt as the Sole Cultural Center**:
  * The school posited that **Egypt** was the primary center of culture, from which **culture traits** spread to other parts of the world through both **diffusion** and **migration**.

> They used both explanations, **diffusion** as well as **migration**, in context of **Egypt** as a centre of culture.

### Criticism

* The **British School** faced criticism for its **narrow views** on **diffusion**, particularly for its exclusive focus on **Egypt** as the origin of all significant **culture traits**.

## Grafton Elliot Smith and Diffusionism

### Background and Influence

* **Profession**: **Grafton Elliot Smith** was an **anatomist** by training.
* **Visit to Egypt**: His trip to **Egypt** profoundly influenced his views, as he became a great admirer of **Egypt’s ancient civilization**.

### Observations and Theory Development

* **Initial Observations at Cambridge**:
  * Upon returning to **Cambridge**, Smith noted striking similarities between the **Egyptian complex of large monuments** associated with **Sun worship** and the **English megaliths**, such as **Stonehenge**.
  * He concluded that the **Druids**, whom he considered **rude and primitive**, could not have independently invented such complex structures.

> These similarities in monuments of **Egypt** and **Megaliths of England** compelled him to think that the rude and primitive **Druids** would not have invented this complex structure. It means they were borrowed from **ancient Egypt**.

* **Further Investigations**:
  * Smith expanded his research to include:
    * **Maya Pyramids**
    * **Japanese Pagodas**
    * **Cambodian and Balinese temples**
    * **American Indian burial monuments**
  * He observed that these structures shared a **basic form**, suggesting a connection to **Egyptian prototypes**.

### Conclusions

* **Egypt as the Cradle of Civilization**:
  * Smith argued that **Egypt** was the **ancient cradle of civilizations**.
  * He proposed that **culture traits** related to **monuments and megaliths** originated in **Egypt** and spread globally from approximately **400 B.C.** onward.
* **Publication**:
  * Smith published his findings in **1911** and continued his investigations thereafter.

## William James Perry and Diffusionism

### Overview of **Perry’s Role**

* **William James Perry** was a staunch supporter of **Grafton Elliot Smith**’s **diffusionist** theories, particularly regarding the spread of culture from **Egypt**.
* While Perry did not contribute specific theoretical advancements, his unwavering support for Smith’s ideas led both to be regarded as **Egyptologists**.

### Fieldwork and Observations

* **Visit to Cairo**:
  * Perry participated in an **archaeological excavation** in **Cairo**, where he observed the remains of a **Sun-temple**.
  * He was deeply impressed by the **Sun-temple** and gathered information on **beliefs and attitudes** related to **Sun worship** among the people of **Cairo**.
* **Publication**:
  * Perry documented his findings in his book, **The Children of the Sun**, published in **1923**.
  * In the book, he referred to **Egyptians** as the **Children of the Sun**, emphasizing the **Sun-God** as a **universal deity**.

> In this book he designated **Egyptians** as the **Children of the Sun**, because only **Sun-God** was regarded as a **universal deity**. Such idea regarding **Sun-God** diffused other parts of the world from **Egypt**.

### Support for **British School of Diffusion**

* **Cultural Contributions Attributed to Egypt**:
  * Perry argued that **Pyramid structures**, **temple building**, and the use of **gold and silver ornaments** originated from **Egyptian civilization**.
  * He fully endorsed Smith’s view that **Egypt** was the **cradle of ancient civilization**.
* **Role in the British School**:
  * Perry’s work reinforced the principles of the **British School of Diffusion**, emphasizing **Egypt** as the source of major **culture traits**.

### Opposition to Other Theories

* Perry rejected the concept of **Psychic Unity** and the idea of **independent inventions** proposed by **evolutionists**.
* He maintained that cultural similarities across regions were the result of the **diffusion of culture traits** from **Egypt**.

## W.H.R. Rivers and Diffusionism

### Background and Early Career

* **Profession**: **W.H.R. Rivers** was primarily a **medical doctor**.
* **Torres Strait Expedition (1898)**:
  * Rivers participated in the **Torres Strait Expedition**, the first **interdisciplinary anthropological expedition** aimed at comprehensively studying **primitive life** through trained investigators.
  * Alongside his students, **C.S. Myers** and **William McDougal**, Rivers examined the **psychological abilities** of natives, focusing on their **sensory capacities**.
  * He concluded that there were **no racial differences** in **pure sense acuity**.

### Contributions to Anthropological Methods

* **Genealogical Method**:
  * In **1900**, Rivers published an article titled **‘A Genealogical Method of Collecting Social and Vital Statistics’**, stemming from his work during the **Torres Strait Expedition**.
  * He recorded **genealogies** and **kinship terms**, observing specific **behavior patterns** associated with them.
  * This work established the **Genealogical Method** as a scientific approach for collecting data on **kinship organization**.

> Since then **Genealogical Method** became a scientific method for collecting data in **Kinship organization**.

* **Study of the Toda**:
  * In **1904**, Rivers conducted fieldwork among the **polyandrous Toda** of the **Nilgiri Hills** in India.
  * His findings were published in a **monograph on the Toda** in **1906**, considered a **classic monograph** on an **Indian tribe**.

### Shift to **Diffusionism**

* **Declaration as a Diffusionist**:
  * In **1911**, Rivers publicly identified as a **diffusionist**.
  * In **1912**, he published an article titled **‘Disappearance of Useful Arts’**, which focused on **degeneration** and the **uninventiveness of the human mind**.
  * He argued that **culture traits** could **degenerate** as well as **progress**.
* **Key Work**:
  * In **1914**, Rivers published **‘The History of Melanesian Society’**, where the theories of **degeneration** and **uninventiveness** were central to his explanations of cultural development.

> The theory of **degeneration** and **uninventiveness** became major tool of explanation in his book **‘The History of Melanesian Society’** published in **1914**.

* **Support for Diffusionist Theories**:
  * Rivers believed that cultural similarities were best explained through **imitation** and **migration**.
  * He strongly supported the **uninventiveness** theory proposed by his contemporaries **Grafton Elliot Smith** and **William James Perry**, advocating for both **migration** and **diffusion** of **cultural traits**.

> **W.H.R. Rivers** opined that the similarities in cultures could be explained in better way by taking into consideration **imitation** and **migration**.

### Decline and Criticisms

* **Initial Prominence**:
  * At one point, Rivers was regarded as a **shining star** in **British Anthropology**, with expectations that he would lead the field.
* **Reasons for Decline**:
  * Rivers faded from prominence in **British Anthropology** due to several shortcomings:
    1. **Limited Scope of Study**:
       * Anthropologist **Lowie** criticized Rivers for not conducting intensive studies in **language**, **art**, **religion**, **history of culture**, or **technology**, questioning how Rivers could compare himself to figures like **Tylor** and **Boas**.
    2. **Overconfidence in Findings**:
       * Rivers was accused of overvaluing his findings, treating them as novel **inventions**.
    3. **Lack of Broad Scholarship**:
       * He was described as poorly read and likened to a **modern mariner**, overly enthusiastic about his discoveries without sufficient grounding.

> There was a time, when **Rivers** appeared as big shining star in **British Anthropology** and it was believed that he would lead **British Anthropology**, but he did not achieve this success and soon disappeared from the scene of **British Anthropology**.

## Weaknesses of the British School of Diffusionism

### Overview

The **British School of Diffusion**, known for its **extreme diffusionist** stance and focus on **Egypt** as the origin of cultural traits, faced significant criticism for its theoretical limitations. Below are the key weaknesses identified:

### Specific Criticisms

1. **Anti-Evolutionist Stance and Overemphasis on Imitation**:
   * **British diffusionists** were staunchly **anti-evolutionists**, asserting that **invention** was rare and cultural similarities resulted solely from **imitation**.
   * While cultures often borrow more than they invent, this does not imply that **inventions** occur only once or in a single location.
   > It is true that every culture borrows more than it invents. But this does not mean that **inventions** are made only once and at a particular place.
2. **Misattribution of Global Civilizations to Egypt**:
   * The school claimed that **world’s civilizations** were a **gift of Egypt**, ignoring the existence of multiple **contemporary civilizations** elsewhere.
3. **Limited Scope of Diffusion**:
   * The **British diffusionists** focused only on the diffusion of individual **culture traits**, neglecting the broader **culture complex**.
4. **Neglect of Non-Material Culture**:
   * Their explanations of **cultural diffusion** overlooked **non-material aspects of culture**, such as beliefs and social practices.
5. **Narrow Focus and Rapid Decline**:
   * Due to their **extremism** and exclusive focus on **Egyptism**, the **British School of Diffusion** had a limited scope, leading to its quick disappearance from **British Anthropology**.
   > It is because of their narrow scope of **diffusion** i.e. **extremism** & **Egyptism** they were last to come, but first to disappear from the scene of **British Schools of Anthropology**.

---

## German School of Diffusionism

### Overview

Unlike the **British School of Diffusion**, which focused exclusively on **Egypt** as the origin of **culture traits**, the **German School of Diffusion** adopted a more nuanced approach. Known as the **Kulturkreise School**, **Culture Circle School**, **Culture District School**, or **Culture Historic School**, it integrated elements of both **diffusion** and **evolution** in explaining cultural development.

### Key Principles
1. **Rejection of Independent Inventions**:
    * **German diffusionists** dismissed the concept of **independent inventions** proposed by **Classical evolutionists**.
    * They emphasized the **theory of cultural diffusion** while also incorporating **evolutionary schemes**.
2. **Multiple Centers of Cultural Development**:
   * Unlike the **British School**, which centered cultural origins in **Egypt**, the **German School** argued that **cultural traits** and **cultural complexes** originated independently in **several different places** at **different times**.

  > According to them development of culture does not take only at a particular place like **Egypt**, but at **several different places** at **different times**.
3. **Diffusion and Migration**:
    * **Cultural traits** and **cultural complexes** spread from their places of origin to other regions through **imitation** or **migration**.
    * The **German School** accepted both **diffusion** and **evolution** as mechanisms for **cultural development and growth**.
4. **Concept of Cultural Circles**:
    * Different **circles** or **districts** of culture developed in various regions during different **phases**.
    * Each **culture trait** or **cultural complex** had a specific **circle** or **district** from which it **migrated** to other areas, though not necessarily globally.
  > As they talk about spread of **culture trait** from one **circle** to another or from one **district** to another, their school is also known as ‘**Kulturkreise School**’ or ‘**Culture Circle School**’ or **Culture District School**.
5. **Historical Basis**:
   * The spread of **culture traits** between **circles** was explained using **historical facts**, leading to the designation of the **Culture Historic School**.

### Key Scholars

The **German School of Diffusion** included the following prominent scholars:
1. **Friedrich Ratzel**
2. **Fritz Graebner**
3. **Father Wilhelm Schmidt**
4. **Leo Frobenius**

### Major Weakness

* The **German School** effectively described **what** constitutes **diffusion** but failed to explain **how** the process of **diffusion** occurs.

  > The greatest weakness of this school of thought is that though it talks about what is **diffusion**, but never explains **how** does **diffusion** takes place.

---

## Friedrich Ratzel and Diffusionism

### Background and Academic Journey

* **Profession**: **Friedrich Ratzel** began his career as a **zoologist**, later transitioning to **geography**, and eventually developing an interest in **anthropology**.

### Key Works

* **Anthropo-Geography** (1882)
* **History of Mankind** (three volumes, 1885–1888)

### Core Diffusionist Beliefs

1. **Imitation Over Creativity**:
    * Like other **diffusionists**, Ratzel believed that **man** was more inclined toward **imitation** than **creativity**.

2. **Tracing Cultural Traits**:
    * Ratzel emphasized the importance of identifying the **origins** and **pathways** of **cultural traits**, asserting that there were **no spatial limits** to their spread.

    > The most important consideration was to discover from where **cultural traits** came and where they went. He was of the opinion that there were **no spatial limits** to the pathways they might take.

3. **Diffusion vs. Migration**:
    * **Single cultural items** typically spread through **diffusion**.
    * **Whole cultural complexes** were transplanted via **migration**.
    * In both cases, **adaptation to environment** caused **variations** in **culture traits**, resulting in different **outward shapes**.

### **Criterion of Form**

* **Recognizing Historical Connections**:
  * Ratzel cautioned that not all similarities indicate a **historical connection**, as certain features of **material culture** are necessary for **utility** (e.g., an **arrowhead** or **spear** must have a point).
  * However, **non-functional similarities** (e.g., **feathers** attached to **spear shafts**) suggest **borrowing** or **migration**, even across significant **time** and **space**.
  > If, however, there were other similar qualities, unrelated to use, they must be evidence of **historical relationship**. So if **spears** have **feathers** attached to their **shafts**, this cannot be accidental; must certainly imply **borrowing** or **migration**, even though respective **cultures** may be widely separated in **time** and **space**.

* Ratzel termed this principle the **Criterion of Form**.

### Perspective on Cultural Change

* **Non-Extreme Degenerationist**:
  * Unlike some **diffusionists**, Ratzel was not an **extreme degenerationist**.
  * He believed that **culture traits** could become **simplified** or **elaborated** during **diffusion** or **migration**, depending on **local conditions** and the **sophistication of local technology**.

* **Biological Influence**:
  * Ratzel’s views were likely shaped by the biological concept of **adaptive radiation**, reflecting his zoological background.

## Fritz Graebner and the Kulturkreise School

### Background and Role

* **Profession**: **Fritz Graebner** was a **museum curator** in Germany.
* **Leadership**: He emerged as the primary leader of the **Kulturkreise School** (Culture Circle School), applying the concepts of **culture circle** and **culture strata** on a global scale.

### Key Work and Methodological Contributions

* **Publication**:
  * Graebner outlined the methodological principles of the **Kulturkreise** movement in his book, **Method of Ethnology** (1911).
  * The book elaborated criteria for identifying **affinities**, **chronologies**, **similarities**, and **historical relationships** among cultures.

* **Criteria for Identifying Cultural Relationships**:
  Graebner, along with **Father Wilhelm Schmidt**, established two fundamental rules for analyzing **culture circles**, **culture districts**, and **culture strata**:

  1. **Criterion of Form** (termed "Quality" by Schmidt):
     * Similarities between two **culture elements** that do not naturally arise from the **material purpose** or **nature** of the traits/objects should be attributed to **diffusion**, regardless of the **distance** separating the instances.

     > Similarities between two **culture elements** which do not automatically arise out of **nature material purpose** of the **traits** or **objects**, should be interpreted as resulting from **diffusion**, regardless of the **distance** which separates the two instances.

  2. **Criterion of Quantity**:
     * The likelihood of a **historical relationship** between two items increases when multiple **similarities** are observed, as multiple similarities provide stronger evidence than a single one.

     > The probability of **historical relationship** between two items increases, i.e. several **similarities** prove more than a single one.

### Reconstruction of Cultural Chronology

* **Focus on Chronology**:
  * Graebner and his followers went beyond tracing cultural connections, aiming to reconstruct **chronologies** of cultural development.
  * Their research focused particularly on **Oceania**, where Graebner identified **six successive layers** of cultural development:

    1. **Tasmanian culture** (the earliest)
    2. **Australian boomerang culture**
    3. **Totemic Hunter culture**
    4. **Two-class horticulturist culture**
    5. **Melanesian bow culture**
    6. **Polynesian patrilineal culture** (the most recent)

### Classification of Diffusion

* Graebner categorized **diffusion** into two types:
  1. **Primary Diffusion**:
     * Represented by the oldest culture, such as the **Tasmanian culture**.
  2. **Secondary Diffusion**:
     * Involved the spread of elements of **complex culture** across **Australia** and beyond.

  > **Tasmanian culture** being oldest one was example of **primary diffusion**. Elements of **complex culture** developed all over **Australia** due to **secondary diffusion**.

## Father Wilhelm Schmidt and the Kulturkreise School

### Contribution to Diffusionism

* **Father Wilhelm Schmidt** was a key figure in the **Kulturkreise School** (Culture Circle School), contributing to the framework of **cultural diffusion**.

### Classification of Culture Circles

* Schmidt identified **four major grades** of **culture circles**, which are:
  1. **Primitive culture circle**
  2. **Primary culture circle**
  3. **Secondary culture circle**
  4. **Tertiary culture circle**

---

## Weaknesses of the Kulturkreise School

### Overview

The **Kulturkreise School** (Culture Circle School) has largely become **defunct** in Europe, though some of its principles continue to be applied by **art historians** to establish relationships between **art styles** or **motifs**. However, these applications focus on specific elements rather than **whole cultures**.

### Key Shortcomings

* **Flawed Premises and Methods**:
  * The weaknesses of the **Kulturkreise School** stemmed from both its **theoretical premises** and its **methodological approaches**.

  > The shortcoming of the theory rested both in its **Premises** and its **methods**.

---

## American School of Diffusion: Overview and Key Concepts

### Founders and Key Figures
* The **American School of Diffusion** was founded by **Franz Boas**.
* His prominent followers included **Clark Wissler**, **A.L. Kroeber**, **Herskovitz**, and **Sapir**.

### Objectives and Critique of Earlier Theories
* **American diffusionists** aimed to address shortcomings in the **culture historic school** identified by **German diffusionists**.
  * **German diffusionists** discussed the complex form of **diffusion of culture** but failed to explain why **diffusion** occurred.
  * **American diffusionists** sought to answer this question through **empirical researches**.
* They discredited the universal sequences proposed by **classical evolutionists**, arguing that **empirical researches** provided evidence of the **give and take of culture traits and culture complexes** facilitated by **transport and communication**.

### Explanations for Cultural Diffusion
**American diffusionists** provided two primary explanations for why **diffusion** takes place:

1. **Imitation**:
   * The process of **imitation** drives the **diffusion of culture traits and complexes** from one place or cultural group to another.
2. **Borrowing for Convenience**:
   * Borrowing **culture traits** from other groups is often easier than inventing them independently.
   * Borrowing groups may adapt **culture traits** to make them useful, meaning **diffused traits may or may not exist in original form**.

### Methodology: Culture Area Approach
* **American diffusionists** developed the **culture area approach** to demonstrate the **diffusion of cultural traits and complexes**.
* Key principles of the **culture area approach**:
  * The world was divided into distinct **cultural areas** based on **geographical regions**.
  * **Geographical aspects** were considered essential in studying **culture areas**.
  * Each **culture area** allowed for the study of specific cultural dimensions.
* Observations on **cultural areas**:
  * Cultural groups in close **geographical areas** exhibit greater **uniformity** compared to those in distant regions.
  * For example, traveling through Europe reveals distinct **cultural areas** with varying degrees of **cultural similarities**.

### Methodological Process
* The process for studying **culture areas** involved:
  1. Dividing the world, a continent, or a country into different **culture areas**.
  2. Compiling a list of **cultural elements or traits** that reached each area through **diffusion**.
  3. Identifying the **causes** of **diffusion** in each area.
* **Clark Wissler** emphasized:
  * Changes in **diffused traits**, particularly in **non-material aspects of culture**, which often prevented them from persisting in their **original form**.
  * **Barriers to cultural diffusion**, such as **mountains**, **forests**, **hills**, **rivers**, and **oceans**.

### Key Concepts Developed
* **American diffusionists** introduced several concepts to support their framework:
  * **Historic Particularism**
  * **Food Area**
  * **Culture Centre**
  * **Age-Area**
  * **Culture Intensity**
  * **Culture Climax**
* These concepts were emphasized by **Wissler** and supported by **Kroeber**, **Herskovitz**, and **Sapir**.

### Contributions and Emphasis
* The **culture area** concept was particularly emphasized by **Wissler** and supported by **Kroeber**, **Herskovitz**, and **Sapir**.
* The **American School of Diffusion** focused on regional analysis rather than global **cultural diffusion**, prioritizing **geographical context** in their studies.
