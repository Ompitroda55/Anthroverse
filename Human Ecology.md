## Concept & Scope

### Adaptation and Environment
* **Living beings** generally possess an in-built capacity to adapt to their environment.
* This ability is well demonstrated through the concepts of:
  * **Variation**
  * **Natural selection**

### Modification of the Environment
* Many species are capable of amending their micro-environment to enhance their survival:
  * **Birds**: Build nests
  * **Mammals**: Create burrows

### Uniqueness of Human Beings
* **Human beings** are the only species capable of significantly changing:
  * Their **micro-environment**
  * Their **macro-environment**
* This unique ability is due to their capacity for **culture**.

## Ecology

###Definition
* **Ecology** refers to the study of the interaction between living beings and their natural environment.
* In **Human Ecology**, *Man* is the living being under consideration.

## Adaptability
* The capacity of a species to change itself to suit the natural environment is known as **adaptability**.
* The term **human adaptability** is also applied to the **biological responses** that improve any function of an individual or group in a specific environment.

### Human Ecology: Definition and Scope
* There is **no standard definition** of the term **Human Ecology**.
* Being an **interdisciplinary concern**, there is **no unanimity** on the scope of the topic.

### Divisions of Human Ecology
* For the sake of convenience, Human Ecology can be divided into:
  * **Cultural ecology**
  * **Biological ecology**

---

## Cultural Ecology

### Early Development

**Social Ecology**
* **A. Hawley**, a sociologist, coined the term **cultural ecology** in the 1930s.
* Drawing from studies on **animal ecology** and **animal behaviour** (already popular during that period), Hawley inferred that such studies could provide valuable insights into the study of **human behaviour**.

**Contributions of Julian Steward**
* In the early 1950s, **Julian Steward** became fully convinced that the **natural environment** had a strong influence on the **social** and **cultural institutions** of all human societies.
* Through the amalgamation of his ideas and those of other anthropologists, **Cultural Ecology** was developed.
* According to **Baker**, Cultural Ecology emphasizes:
  * The regularities of **human behaviour**, **social structures**, and **values** that develop or evolve in response to particular **natural environmental niches** or **situations**.

**Focus Areas of Cultural Ecology**
* **Traditional Focus**:
  * Majority of cultural ecological studies are concerned with **pre-literate** and **traditional societies**.
* **Recent Trends**:
  * Study of effects of:
    * Variations in **environmental resources**
    * Changes in **population sizes**
    * **External intrusion** of other societies on **cultural evolution**

## Evolutionary Ecology

**Approach and Unit of Study**
* Initiated in the **1970s**, **Evolutionary Ecology** shifted the unit of study to the **individual** rather than the **population**.
* Models validated on **other animal species** are applied to **individual humans**.

**Contributions and Key Areas**
* Proponents such as **Adam Smith** believe that Evolutionary Ecology can help clarify:
  1. Why people use specific behaviours for obtaining **food**.
  2. Why they develop various **mating practices**.
  3. Why they distribute themselves over **space** in different manners.
  4. Why they differ in interrelated characteristics such as **population dynamics** and **community structure**.

**Hypotheses and Focus**
* A number of hypotheses have been formulated by **Winterhalder** and other **evolutionary ecologists** to test various models.
* The major emphasis has been on **behaviour related to the acquisition of food**.

---

## Biological Human Ecology

### Core Focus
* **Biological Human Ecology** emphasizes the effects of environments—**man-made** or **natural**—on the **biological traits** of human populations.
* Unlike the **behavioural interests** of evolutionary ecologists, the focus here is on **biological impacts**.

### Assumptions and Approaches
* **Biological anthropologists** come from various scientific streams, resulting in:
  * No **standard set of assumptions** or **uniform approaches**.
* However, a universally accepted assumption is:
  * During the course of **evolution**, **selection** resulted in the survival and spread of **certain traits** essential for the evolution of **our own species**.

### Historical Context
* Before the advent of Biological Human Ecology:
  * Scientists (including **physiologists** and **epidemiologists**) assumed **causal relationships** for various phenomena, considering them **universally applicable**.
  * These early assumptions **ignored the impact of cultural diversities**.
* Although **theoretical postulates** and **traditional definitions of physiology** still have much to contribute, many other **physical** and **natural sciences** have recently broadened the scope of Biological Human Ecology.

### Modern Paradigm
* A **more comprehensive approach** has developed for examining how people adapt to their particular environments.
* This paradigm emphasizes that a population's **adaptive response** to environmental stress likely involves several mechanisms:
  * **Learned responses**
  * **Species-wide physiological adjustment capabilities** (acclimatisation)
  * **Population-specific genetic characteristics**, which are the result of **natural selection** (Baker 1990)

## Human Adaptability

### Challenges in Human Ecology
* As mentioned earlier, the **diversity** in the background, goals, and approaches of researchers has been a major **impediment** to evolving a common focus and set of theories in **human ecology**.
* However, it is commonly recognized that:
  * The effects of **natural** and **cultural environments** (ignoring chance and supernatural effects) should ultimately be key to explaining **human functioning** and **behaviour**.
* With a common perspective and increasing research data:
  * **Human ecology** may eventually evolve into a **unified sub-discipline** of **Anthropology**.

### Evolution Towards Human Adaptability
* It is now widely realized that:
  * Natural and cultural environments affect **biological traits** individually (e.g., effect of **radiation** on skin and body) and specifically (e.g., **resistance to cold**).
  * Changes in **culture**, followed by associated **stress** and **strain**, affect the human body.
  * Humans — both **individually** and **collectively** — continuously adapt to changing environments.
* As a result:
  * The field of **human ecology** is now more often referred to as **Human Adaptability**.

### Research Design Challenges
* **Formulating research designs** in the study of human adaptability is not easy because:
  * We ideally need **two individuals** or **groups** within a society that differ **only** in the **one trait under study**.
* Example:
  * To study the effects of **high altitude hypoxia**, we would require:
    * Two groups with **identical cultural attributes** and **social preferences**, differing only in the **altitude** of their habitation.
* Limitations:
  * Achieving such an ideal setting is almost **impossible**.
  * Humans cannot be subjected to **deliberate experimental situations**.
  * Therefore, conclusions drawn from such studies must be regarded as **tentative**.

### Future Directions
* The evolving sub-discipline of **Human Adaptability** must create ways to:
  * **Identify** the extent of **variations** in inferences.
  * **Address** the inherent difficulties in approaching **near-ideal research settings**.

## Tolerance to Natural Stresses

### Coping with Environmental Stress
* Modern science has developed certain **methods** and **resources** allowing living beings to survive in almost any environment for varying durations.
* However, all living beings are composed of **living cells**, and the **survival of these cells** (and thus the survival of living beings) depends on:
  * Their **potential to cope with stress**.

### Types of Natural Stress
* Nature exerts stress in multiple ways, including:
  * **Temperature**
  * **Pressure**
  * **Radiation**
  * **Nutrition**
* Most living species have **adapted** themselves to survive within **specific econiches**.

### Adaptation Among Mammals and Primates
* **Many mammals** today have evolved the ability to adapt to **various terrestrial environments**.
* **Early primates**, however, developed within **specific ecological niches** and have **not** evolved adaptations to live across all types of environments.

### Homo erectus and Environmental Expansion
* It was probably **Homo erectus** who, due to knowledge of the **uses of fire**, could venture into **hostile, extremely cold climates** previously inaccessible.
* Otherwise, it is generally believed that most of **human evolution** occurred in areas characterized by:
  * **Hot daytime temperatures**
  * **Comparatively cooler nights**
  * **High solar radiation**
  * **Comparatively low humidity**
  * **Relatively high atmospheric pressure**

---

## Adaptation to Heat

### Homeostatic System and Body Temperature
* A **homeostatic system** aims to maintain an almost **constant temperature**.
* The **human body** strives to maintain a temperature around **37°C**, at which it functions most efficiently.
* However, normal body temperature fluctuates due to factors like:
  * **Age**
  * **Sex**
  * **Nature of physical activity**
  * **Weather**
  * **Time of the day**
* Example:
  * Young adults at rest (with only basic metabolic activities) may have a normal temperature around **30°C**, provided there is minimal heat loss due to cold surroundings.

### Risks of Rising Body Temperature
* A **rise in body temperature** impairs activity.
* A **4-5°C increase** above the normal can cause **permanent damage** to any body system or result in **death**.
* **Heat loss to surroundings** is essential to bring body temperature back to normal.
  * This is possible **only** if the surrounding temperature is **lower than the body temperature**.

### Mechanisms of Heat Loss (Following Baker, 1990)
* **Sweat glands** in humans:
  * Over **one million** sweat glands, with minor population variations.
  * **Activation** of sweat glands occurs during **childhood**.
    * Exposure to **acute heat stress** during childhood leads to more sweat glands being activated, resulting in better **heat tolerance** throughout life.
* **Sweat capacity and acclimatization**:
  * In extremely hot deserts:
    * A young male staying briefly may sweat up to **4 liters/hour**.
    * This gradually stabilizes to about **2 liters/hour**.
    * An individual living longer may excrete around **8 liters of sweat per day**.

### Factors Affecting Sweating
* Sweating depends on:
  * **Body temperature** relative to **external temperature**
  * **Radiation load**
  * **Relative humidity**
* Environmental conditions:
  * **Hot desert and savanna**: Promote quick sweat evaporation.
  * **Hot, humid conditions** (e.g., coal mines, sea-shores): Hamper sweat evaporation, reducing sweat gland efficiency.
* **Body fat content** also influences the **rate of sweating**.

### Research Findings (Baker, 1955)
* **Relationship between**:
  * **Radiation load**
  * **Temperature**
  * **Relative humidity**
* (Refer to figure mentioned in the original source.)

### Variations in Heat Tolerance
* **Age, sex, body shape, size, and composition** cause significant variations.
* **Newborns**:
  * Underdeveloped **sweat glands** and **neurological apparatus**.
  * Larger **surface area relative to body mass** → rapid increase in body temperature with higher air temperature and radiation load.
  * **Little (1973)** concludes:
    * High air temperatures and radiation load are significant factors in **high infant mortality**.
* **Children**:
  * High **surface area (SA)** to **body mass (BM)** ratio:
    * **SA/BM ratio** is about **0.6 sqm/gm** in infants.
    * In adults, it drops to about **0.03**.
  * **Taller individuals** with longer limbs may have slightly higher ratios.

* **Adults**:
  * Lower **SA/BM** ratio → much **higher heat tolerance**.
  * **Subcutaneous fat** also influences heat tolerance.

### Impact of Body Weight
* A study on **American soldiers during World War II** showed:
  * "Men **10 percent above average weight for height** had **death rates nine times** those of men **10 percent below average weight for height**."

### Effects of High Humidity
* In **areas with high relative humidity** (hot, humid areas):
  * **Sweat evaporation** occurs very slowly.
  * This **negatively impacts heat tolerance**.

### Population Differences and Acclimatization
* Population differences exist based on:
  * **Natural environments**
  * **Working conditions**
* However:
  * With **increasing acclimatization** to a particular environment, **population and individual differences** in heat tolerance tend to **merge**.

## Adaptation to Cold

### Human Cold Adaptation: General Overview
* Humans possess a **large body mass** compared to surface area.
* Despite adaptation to colder environments, **tropical origins** remain a legacy.
* Compared to **arctic animals**, human cold adaptation is limited:
  * **Arctic animals** have thick fur or hair.
  * **Humans** lack insulating fur and rely mainly on **subcutaneous fat** for insulation.

### Heat Loss and Human Response (Following Baker, 1990)
* When **atmospheric temperature** drops below **28°C**:
  * **Persistent heat loss** to surroundings begins.
  * **Arterioles** below the subcutaneous fat **vasoconstrict**.
    * **Warm blood** from the body's core is **shunted away from the skin**.
    * As **skin temperature declines**, **core heat loss reduces**.
* Specific Responses:
  * **Inactive individuals** with heavy subcutaneous fat can maintain neutral core temperature at air temperatures as low as **15°C**.
  * **Thin individuals** may trigger further homeostatic responses, like **shivering**, even at **25°C**.
* Behavioral Responses:
  * **Huddling** reduces surface area for heat loss.
  * **Voluntary muscular activity** increases heat production.

### Shivering and Voluntary Activity
* If inactivity continues and core temperature falls:
  * **Involuntary muscle contractions** (shivering) begin.
  * **Shivering** can double (**100% increase**) the metabolic level above basal.
* **Voluntary activities** (e.g., running) produce even more heat but can only be maintained for a limited time at high metabolic outputs.

### Importance of Subcutaneous Fat
* **Subcutaneous fat** significantly impacts **cold tolerance**:
  * A **3–4°C drop** from normal core temperature can lead to **loss of mental alertness**.
  * A further **3–4°C dip** can cause **unconsciousness**, though recovery without permanent tissue damage is possible.
  * Individuals with **greater subcutaneous fat** are less affected under these conditions.
* **Normal fit young adults** can survive low temperatures for several hours with low wind speeds, mainly by generating enough heat through physical activity.

### Comparison: Cold Tolerance vs. Heat Tolerance
* Human **tolerance to cold** is:
  * Much **lower** than tolerance to heat.
  * **Highly varied** among different human populations.

### Fire and Clothing: Cultural Adaptations
* **Early humans** and **modern hunter-gatherers** used **fire** to combat cold, even surviving without clothing.
* **Clothing** has been critical:
  * Humans, through **scientific advancements and specialized clothing**, can now withstand temperatures well below freezing.

### Influence of Age and Sex (Hanna, 1976)
* Study: **Highland Quechua Indians of Peru**.
* Findings:
  * **Children** have **least tolerance to cold**.
    * Due to **lower skin-fold thickness**.
    * **Less neurological development** during infancy and childhood.
  * Children's **core body temperature** falls rapidly early during sleep and remains relatively stable at basal metabolism.

## Body Weight and Cold Tolerance
* **Body mass** plays a crucial role:
  * With the same height, **heavier individuals** can better tolerate cold due to insulation from **subcutaneous fat**.

### Sex Differences in Cold Tolerance
* Women:
  * Generally **shorter** with **shorter limbs** → **less surface area per unit body mass**.
  * Have **thicker subcutaneous fat**, suggesting **higher core temperatures**.
* However:
  * **Experimental studies** during **physical exercise in cold environments** show **no significant sex differences** in cold tolerance.

### Population Studies: Genetic and Environmental Factors
* Comparative Studies:
  * **No significant differences found**:
    * Lampietro et al. (1959): **US Blacks vs. US Whites**.
    * Elsner et al. (1960): **Canadian Indians vs. Whites**.
  * **Significant differences found**:
    * Scholander et al. (1958): **Native Australians vs. Whites**.
    * Hart et al. (1962): **Inuit vs. Whites**.
    * Anderson et al. (1960): **Lapps vs. Whites**.
    * Baker et al. (1966): **Quechua vs. Whites**.
  * Common finding:
    * **Whites** generally exhibited **lower skin temperatures**.

* Hammel (1964) proposes:
  * Human evolution likely took place in **tropical areas**.
  * Populations living in **tropical savannas** may have developed a **genetic adaptation** to cold sleeping conditions.
  * Such adaptations might have been **lost** in populations native to other environments.

## **Adaptation to Altitude**

### **Relationship Between Altitude, Air Density, and Atmospheric Pressure**
* There exists an **inverse relationship** between:
  * Density of air
  * Atmospheric pressure
  * Altitude
* This can be observed while traveling in a plane where the flight captain announces altitude and outside atmospheric conditions.

### **Stress Factor at High Altitude: Hypoxia**
* **High altitude**: 2500 meters (~8000 feet) and above sea level.
* **Hypoxia**: 
  * Partial pressure of oxygen is significantly reduced.
  * Amount of oxygen available per unit of air to vital body systems is highly diminished.
  * Results in great physiological stress.

### **Initial Physiological Response to High Altitude**
* **Little & Moren (1979)**:
  * Hypoxic conditions start affecting humans at about 2000 meters above sea level.
  * At 4000 meters, oxygen availability to the blood becomes significantly low.

* **Symptoms in low altitude visitors**:
  * Immediate increase in breathing rate.
  * Faster heart rate.
  * These changes help in seeking more oxygen from the environment.
  * Acclimatization occurs after a few days, allowing normal body function.

### **Studies on High Altitude Hypoxia**
* Conducted under the **International Biological Programme**.

### **Findings:**
* **Low altitude natives migrating to high altitude** adapt by **reduced oxygen consumption**.

### **Key Observations:**
* **Baker (1969)**:
  * Decrease of 24.4% in US Whites.
  * Decrease of 9.7% in Quechua Indians.
* **Other Observations**:
  * **Peruvian sailors (Velasquez, 1964)**: 19.5% reduction.
  * **English mountain-climbers (Pugh, 1958)**: 20.6% reduction.
  * **US White athletes**:
    * **Reeves et al (1967)**: 25.1% reduction.
    * **Buskirk et al (1967)**: 27.2% reduction.
* **Impact on Work Capacity**:
  * Even a stay of up to 1 year does not bring significant improvement.
  * Significant improvement is noted only after a stay of over 5 years.
  * Upon returning to low altitude, oxygen consumption capacity rises back.

## **Adaptation of High Altitude Natives**
* **High altitude natives** do not experience an increase in oxygen consumption upon return to low altitudes.
* **Studies on high altitude natives** show **inconsistent conclusions**.

### **Physical Growth Patterns at High Altitudes**

**Findings:**
* **Project Study "Man in the Andes"**:
  * South American Andean children:
    * Low physical growth rates, especially during infancy and adolescence.
* **Other Regional Studies**:
  * **Tien Shan mountains (CIS)**: Results similar to the Andes.
  * **Highland Sherpa of Nepal (Pawson, 1974)**:  
    * No significant difference in physical growth compared to low-altitude counterparts.
  * **Ethiopian Highlanders**:
    * Exhibit faster growth rates than low-landers.

### **Conclusions Regarding Growth Variations**:
* No definitive reasons specified by investigators.
* Likely **overestimation** of high-altitude effects, overlooking other environmental and genetic factors.

## **Final Conclusion (Baker, 1990)**

> "The high-altitude populations of the world appear well adapted to their environment in spite of the fact that temporary sojourners suffer a variety of symptoms and perhaps a permanent reduction in work capacity. While a short-term acclimatizational process contributes to native abilities, it appears that either developmental change or genetic adaptation is necessary for people to become fully functional at the higher elevations."

* **Buskirk (1978) Graph**:
  * Suggests that, in the near future, most people reaching the summit of Mount Everest (Sagarmatha) will likely be native residents of high-altitude regions.

## Bergman's Rule & Allen's Rule

### Bergman's Rule

* **Origin**:
  * Proposed by **C. Bergman (1847)**.
  * Based on the correlation between **climatic conditions** and **body size**.
* **Statement**:
  * "Within a polytypic warm-blooded species, the body size of the sub-species usually increases with decreasing mean temperature of its habitat."
* **Application to Humans**:
  * Applied to human species more recently by **D.F. Roberts**.
  * Study details:
    * Examined **116 samples** from various indigenous populations.
    * Found a **coefficient of correlation (r)** of **0.6**.
  * Using both **height and weight** and applying **multivariate analysis**:
    * Found an **r value** of **0.82 for men** and **0.704 for women**.
* **Further Findings**:
  * Roberts subdivided male samples by **geographic distribution**, leading to a specific graph.
  * **Newman (1953)**, using a larger number of populations, reached **similar conclusions**.
* **Interpretation of Graph**:
  * **Populations without recent migration history** show a **much steeper regression**.
  * **Populations with migration history** (e.g., **American Indians**, **Southeast Asian Mongoloids**) show a less steep regression.
* **Debate on Factors**:
  * **Roberts** attributes variation to **genetic differences**.
  * **Newman** emphasizes the role of **nutritional factors**.
* **Key Conclusion**:
  * Regardless of differing views, **Roberts' graph validates Bergman's Rule for human populations**.

---

### Allen's Rule

* **Origin**:
  * Proposed by **Allen (1877)**.
  * Focuses on **body proportions** relative to climate.
* **Statement**:
  * "The relative size of exposed portions of the body decreases with the decrease of mean temperature."
* **Application to Humans**:
  * **Roberts** examined:
    * **Relative Sitting Height Vertex** (sitting height as a proportion of total height).
    * **Span** (maximum fingertip-to-fingertip distance when arms are fully stretched).
* **Findings**:
  * **Observations by Roberts (1978)**:
    * Show a similar correlation pattern as seen in Bergman's Rule.
    * Validate the application of **Allen's Rule** to human populations.
    * Populations living in **hotter climates** exhibit a **higher relative sitting height vertex**.
* **Impact of Recent Trends**:
  * **Secular trends** (e.g., **increases in height** over recent decades) may lead to **modifications** of Roberts' conclusions in the future.

---

## Allen's Rule: Shape-Shifting to Beat Climate Change

### 1. Introduction to Allen's Rule

* **Background**:
  * Warm-blooded animals maintain a **constant internal body temperature** to prevent overheating.
  * Examples:
    * **Elephants** use their **ear flaps** to regulate body temperature.
    * **Birds** regulate temperature through their **bills**.
* **Historical Origin**:
  * In the **1870s**, American zoologist **Joel Allen** observed that:
    * Warm-blooded animals in **colder climates** had **smaller appendages** than those in **warmer parts**.
  * This observation became known as **Allen's Rule**.

### 2. Climate Change and Urgency

* **August 2021 Report**:
  * The **Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)** indicated that:
    * We have **very little time** to **avert catastrophic global warming**.

### 3. Importance for Conservation

* **Application**:
  * Allen's Rule enables planners to:
    * **Identify species** most vulnerable to climate change.
    * **Prioritize conservation** efforts accordingly.

### 4. Recent Research on Animal Adaptations

* **Deakin University Study**:
  * Investigated how animals are **changing the size** of their:
    * **Ears**, **tails**, **beaks**, and other appendages.
  * **Findings**:
    * Multiple examples of "**shapeshifter animals**" were identified.
    * The pattern is **widespread**.
    * Suggests that **climate warming** may lead to **fundamental changes in animal form**.

### 5. Mammals and Shapeshifting Evidence

* **Masked Shrew**:
  * Since **1950**, the **tail and leg length** have **increased significantly**.
* **Great Roundleaf Bat**:
  * **Wing size** increased by **1.64%** over the same period.

### 6. Broader Implications of Appendage Changes

* **Beyond Temperature Regulation**:
  * Animal appendages also have **other vital uses**.
* **Example: Galapagos Medium Ground Finch**:
  * **Beak size** changed over time in response to **seed size**, which is influenced by **rainfall**.
  * Data shows:
    * **Rainfall** determines **beak size**.
    * After **drier summers**, **survival of small-beaked birds** was reduced.
    * Research concluded that **birds with smaller beaks** were **less likely to survive summers**.

### 7. Conclusion

* **Biological Patterns and Predictions**:
  * Patterns like **Allen's Rule** can help **predict** how animals may **evolve** as the **climate warms**.
* **Final Note**:
  * While predicting responses is important, the **best way to avert disaster** remains to **reduce greenhouse gas emissions**.
