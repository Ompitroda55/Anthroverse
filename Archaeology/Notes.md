# Indian Archaeology

## Introduction
* **Stone Age Cultures** are prehistoric cultures found globally, named for their use of stone tools.
* These cultures are categorized based on the antiquity of finds and the level of technology in tool-making.
* General terminology includes:
  * **Palaeolithic** (Old Stone Age), with subdivisions: **Lower Palaeolithic**, **Middle Palaeolithic**, and **Upper Palaeolithic**.
  * **Mesolithic** (Middle Stone Age).
  * **Neolithic** (New Stone Age).

### Palaeolithic Cultures
**Lower Palaeolithic**
* Associated with **Homo erectus**.
* Characterized by **core-tool tradition**:
  * Tools include crude **hand-axes**, **choppers**, and **chopping tools**.
  * Prepared by **direct percussion**.
* Material: **quartzite**, a coarse material resulting in tools with uneven edges.

**Middle Palaeolithic**
* Generally attributed to **Neanderthals**.
* Characterized by:
  * Abundance of **flakes** and **flake-tools**.
  * Finely-made **hand-axes**.
* Material: **quartzite**, similar to Lower Palaeolithic, lending uneven edges to tools.

**Upper Palaeolithic**
* Specialized in:
  * Advanced **fluting bone tools**.
  * **Palaeolithic Art**, also known as **Cave Art**.

### Mesolithic Cultures
* Represented by:
  * **Blade tools** made from **crypto-crystalline silica** (e.g., **flint**, **chert**, **jasper**, **agate**, **chalcedony**).
  * Techniques: **pressure flaking**, **indirect flaking**, and **prepared core technique**.
* Typical tools:
  * **Shouldered tools (Celts)**, prepared by **grinding and polishing technique**.

### Neolithic Cultures
* Associated with:
  * **Pottery**, found alongside Neolithic tool types.

### Stone Age Cultures in India
**Overview**
* **Lower Palaeolithic** and **Middle Palaeolithic** parallels are found across India.
* Evidence for later cultures (**Upper Palaeolithic** and **Mesolithic**) is less consistent compared to global findings.

**Challenges with Upper Palaeolithic in India**
* **Advanced fluting technique**: Evidence is not conclusive in India.
* **Bone tools**:
  * Characteristic of **Upper Palaeolithic Culture** in Europe but not frequently found in India.
  * Possible reasons:
    * Lack of knowledge about such tools by early humans in India.
    * **Acidic soil** in India may have destroyed bone tools, contributing to the paucity of **fossils of early man**.
> "We must not forget that we have paucity of fossils of early man in India and one main reason given is that Indian soil is more acidic than elsewhere."

**Palaeolithic Art and Microlithic Cultures**
* **Palaeolithic Art** in India:
  * Associated with **microlithic cultures**.
  * Difficult to differentiate between **Upper Palaeolithic** and **Mesolithic microliths** in India.

**Terminology Adjustments in India**
* To address confusion:
  * Parallels of European **Lower Palaeolithic** and **Middle Palaeolithic** were termed **Early Stone Age** and **Middle Stone Age**, respectively.
  * **Upper Palaeolithic-Mesolithic complex** was designated as **Late Stone Age**.
* Recent shift:
  * Indian anthropologists and archaeologists have reverted to the traditional terminology: **Palaeolithic** (**Lower**, **Middle**, **Upper**), **Mesolithic**, and **Neolithic**.

### Key Terminology
* **Stone Age Cultures**: Prehistoric cultures defined by stone tool use.
* **Palaeolithic**: Old Stone Age, subdivided into Lower, Middle, and Upper stages.
* **Mesolithic**: Middle Stone Age, marked by blade tools and advanced techniques.
* **Neolithic**: New Stone Age, associated with pottery.
* **Core-tool tradition**: Crude tools like hand-axes, choppers, and chopping tools.
* **Flake-tools**: Tools made from flakes, prominent in Middle Palaeolithic.
* **Fluting bone tools**: Advanced bone tools of the Upper Palaeolithic.
* **Palaeolithic Art**: Cave art associated with Upper Palaeolithic.
* **Crypto-crystalline silica**: Materials like flint, chert, jasper, agate, and chalcedony used in Mesolithic tools.
* **Pressure flaking**, **Indirect flaking**, **Prepared core technique**: Advanced tool-making methods.
* **Shouldered tools (Celts)**: Mesolithic tools prepared by grinding and polishing.

## Location of Stone Age Cultures

## Introduction
* **Early man** typically inhabited areas close to water sources, influencing the locations where their cultural remains are found.
* Key locations include **ancient rivers**, **lakes**, and, to a lesser extent, **glacier-formed moraines**.

### Primary Locations of Early Human Remains
**River Terraces**
* **Formation**: Rivers create **river terraces** through **erosional activity**.
* **Stratigraphy**:
  * Oldest terraces are located at the **top layer**.
  * Youngest terraces are found at the **bottom layer**.
* **Significance**: Remains of **early human cultures** are commonly found on or within these **river terraces**.

**Lake-Beds**
* **Formation**: **Lake-beds** are formed through **depositional activity**.
* **Stratigraphy**:
  * **Topmost beds** are the youngest.
  * Older beds are located beneath.
* **Significance**: Remains of **early man** are also found in **lake-beds**, reflecting their proximity to water sources.

**Glacial Moraines**
* **Formation**: Formed by the activity of **glaciers**, resulting in **moraines**.
* **Significance in India**:
  * Remains in **moraines** are less useful for reconstructing **ancient cultural history** in India.
> "Remains of early man may also be found in the activity of glaciers (that form morains) but this kind of remains in INDIA donâ€™t help much in the reconstruction of ancient cultural history."

### Key Terminology
* **Early man**: Prehistoric humans associated with **Stone Age cultures**.
* **River terraces**: Landforms created by **erosional activity** of rivers, containing cultural remains.
* **Lake-beds**: Sedimentary deposits formed by **depositional activity**, preserving remains of **early man**.
* **Moraines**: Deposits formed by **glaciers**, less significant for cultural reconstruction in India.
* **Erosional activity**: Process by which rivers shape **terraces** and expose cultural remains.
* **Depositional activity**: Process forming **lake-beds**, with younger layers on top.

  * Southern Hemisphere:
    * Four **rainy seasons** (**pluvials**): **Kageran**, **Kamesian**, and **Gamblian**.
    * Separated by three **dry seasons** (**interpluvials**).

### Impact on Stone Tool Cultures
* **Settlement Patterns**:
  * During **rainy** or **snowy seasons**, early humans resided in **cave-shelters**.
  * During **dry seasons**, they preferred **open-air sites**.
* **Archaeological Evidence**:
  * Remains of **stone-tool cultures** are found in:
    * **Cave shelter sites**.
    * **River terraces**.
> "During the Rainy or Snowy seasons man lived in the cave-shelters while in dry times he preferred to live in the open. Consequently, we find the remains of stone-tool cultures in cave shelter sites or the terraces."

## Lower and Middle Palaeolithic Cultures in India

### Lower Palaeolithic Cultures
**Tool Types and Evolution**
* **Primary Tool**: **Crude hand-axe**, evolving from heavy, crude forms to smaller, finely made, and handy versions.
* Other tools:
  * **Choppers**: Prominent in initial stages.
  * **Cleavers**: Appear in later stages.
  * **Flakes**: Initially a by-product of **core-tools**, later the main focus of tool-makers.
* **Comparison**: Indian **Lower Palaeolithic** tool cultures are comparable to those in **Europe**.

**Regional Variations**
**A. Soan River (Described by de Terra and Paterson)**
* **Upper Terraces** (Older):
  * **Crude, heavy hand-axes** and **chopping tools** made on **pebbles**.
* **Lower Terraces** (Younger):
  * Small, finely worked **hand-axes**, **cleavers**, **discoidal cores**, **flakes**, and **chopping tools**.
* **Late Soan Cultures**:
  * Previously thought to represent **Middle Palaeolithic**, but primarily show a **flake tool industry**.

**B. Beas River (Described by B. B. Lal)**
* **Chopper and chopping tools**:
  * Most abundant in **Punjab**.
  * Decrease in frequency southward, southeast, and southwest.
* Uncertainty:
  * Unclear if **chopping tools** are a local variation or a continuation of **East Asian traditions**.
* **Later Stage**: Frequency of **chopping tools** diminishes significantly.

**C. South India: Madrasian Culture**
* Named after **Attirampakkam** near **Madras**, located on the **Budida Manu Vanka River**.
* **Stratigraphy**:
  * **Uppermost Level**: **Microliths**.
  * **Middle Level**: **Flake tools**.
  * **Lower Level**: **Hand-axes**, **cleavers**, and other **Lower Palaeolithic** tools.
* **Distinction**:
  * Lower proportion of **choppers and chopping tools** compared to **Punjab**.
> "The major difference between Soan and Madrasian cultures is with respect to the occurrence of chopping tools as the proportion of these tools to the total assembly of tools."

**D. Adamgarh Hill (Narmada Valley)**
* **Lower Strata**:
  * **Crude hand-axes**, **chopping tools**, **ovates**, and a few **cleavers**.
* **Higher Strata**:
  * Increased presence of **cleavers** with varied shapes and probable functions.
* **Significance**:
  * Demonstrates **continuity of habitation** and evolution through **indigenous experiences**.

### Materials and Techniques
* **Early Stage**:
  * Tools made from **pebbles**, resulting in rounded shapes.
  * **Bulb of percussion**: Massive, using **direct hammer technique**.
* **Later Stage**:
  * Raw materials shifted to **boulders** and **outcrops of rocks**.
  * More sophisticated techniques employed.
* **Primary Material**:
  * **Quartzite** or **quartzite-pebbles**, abundant in **rock outcrops** and **boulders**.

### Habitation Patterns
* **Cave Use**:
  * Early humans rarely inhabited **caves** during **Lower Palaeolithic** times.
  * At **Gudiyam Cave** near **Madras**:

    * Small assemblage size limits definitive conclusions.

### Chronology and Cultural Development
* **Emergence**: Tentatively dated to the **early Upper Pleistocene**.
* **Regional Variation**:
  * Areas like **western zones** may represent late colonization.
  * Densely populated regions: **Narmada**, **Krishna**, **Mahanadi**, and **Burhabalang**.
* **Cultural Traditions**:
  * **Abbevillian types**: Intruded into **Acheulian** industries.
  * Evidence of **Late Acheulians** without **Abbevillian indicators**, suggesting distinct stages.
* **Acheulian Tradition**:
  * Younger in India than in **France**.
  * Conservative estimate: **100,000 to 60,000 years ago**.
  * Recent estimate (Current Anthropology, 1992): Earliest **Acheulian** at **350,000 years ago**.
> "A recent article in Current Anthropology (1992) has put the earliest date for Acheulian in India at about 3,50,000 years ago. Thus, to expect a kind of human evolution with cultural association in the line of Olduvai Gorge in India would not be entirely correct."

## Middle Palaeolithic Cultures
### Tool Characteristics

  * Reflects logical **litho-cultural evolution**.
* **Shivna and Main Narmada Valley**:
  * **Middle Palaeolithic** appears exotic due to new **stone age** characteristics.
  * Contrasts with **Bhimbetkaâ€™s** continuity.

### Regional and Cultural Variations
* **Mousterian Influence**:
  * Similarities with **Mousterian** industries in **Afghanistan** and **Zagros Mountains**.
  * Estimated chronology by **Bridget Allchin**: **45,000 to 25,000 B.P.**.
* **Local Developments**:
  * **Maharashtrian Karnataka**: Features a **Levallois-based Middle Palaeolithic** with **Mousteroid character**.
  * **Kurnool to Chhattisgarh**:
    * Developed an effective, locally distinct **Middle Palaeolithic**.
    * Emphasis on **borers** over **points**, reducing the prominence of **Levallois technique**.
  * **Andhra and Orissa**:
    * Show differential growth with a focus on **scrapers** and **borers**.
    * **Leaf-shaped points** and **Levallois technique** become less significant.
> "In fact, it becomes difficult to visualize how these scraper and borer dominating tool-kit could be of any use for an actively hunting and gathering population."

### Challenges in Understanding Middle Palaeolithic
* **Later Phase**:
  * Least understood due to overlap with **Upper Palaeolithic** industries.

### Regional Neolithic Cultures
**A. North India: Burzhom (Kashmir)**
* **Chronology**:
  * Dated to **2375 BC**, with the latest tools around **2500 years old**.
* **Cultural Finds**:
  * **Coarse grey or black burnished pottery**.
  * **Bone tools**: **Points**, **awls**, **needles**, **harpoons**.
  * **Stone tools**: **Axes with pointed butts**, **ring stones**, **pierced rectangular choppers or knives**.
* **Cultural Practices**:
  * Evidence of **ceremonial burning of dogs with their masters**, suggesting **religious practices**.
> "Evidence of ceremonial burning of dogs with their masters indicate about some sort of religious practices prevalent among the people."

**B. Peninsular India**
* **Chronology**:
  * Dated between **2300 BC to 1500 BC**.
* **Key Sites**:
  * **Brahmagiri** (Karnataka), **Sangankallu** (Bellary), **Peninsular** (Andhra Pradesh).
* **Tool Types**:
  * Western regions: Emphasis on **blade implements** and **pottery**.
  * Eastern regions: Dominance of **Celts**, **ring stones**, and **grinding stones**.
* **Cultural Indicators**:
  * Evidence of **cultural continuity** and **prolonged settlement**.
  * **Agricultural production** and **cattle-rearing economy**.
  * **Developed human dwellings**: **Mud-floors**, **circular huts** made of **wattle and daub** or **wooden frames**.
* **Metal Use**:
  * **Copper** and **bronze objects** appear toward the close of the **Neolithic age**.

**C. Eastern India**
* **Challenges**:
  * Most findings are **surface finds**, making precise dating difficult.
* **Key Regions**:
  * **Nagaland** and **Brahmaputra Valley**:
    * Unique **quadrangular adzes**, **shouldered hoes**, and **megalithic monuments**.
  * **Bengal, Bihar, Orissa**:
    * Tools include **adzes**, **axes**, **hammer-stones**, **shouldered tools**, and **perforated tools**.
    * **Poor pottery** is common.
* **Agricultural Practices**:
  * Circumstantial evidence of **jhooming** (slash-and-burn cultivation).

### Summary by Agarwal (1981)
* **North-western Neolithic** (e.g., **Kili Ghul Mohammad**, northwest Pakistan):
  * **Phase I**: Pre-ceramic, with **mud-structures**, **bone**, **chert**, **polished stone tools**, and domestication of **goat**, **sheep**, and **cattle**.
  * **Phase II**: Introduction of **hand-made pottery**.
* **Northern Neolithic** (e.g., **Burzhom**):
  * **Period I**: **Hand-made pottery**, **bone**, and **ground stone tools**, with **underground dwelling pits**.
  * **Period II**: Introduction of **metal** and **wheel-made pottery**.
  * No evidence of **domesticated plants and animals** in Period I.
* **Eastern Zone**:
  * Marked by **ground stone artifacts** and **handmade cord-impressed pottery**.
  * Dating is insecure; some artifacts appear in **historical levels**.
  * Variants in **Orissa** and **Bihar** suggest **jhooming**.
* **Southern Neolithic**:
  * Characterized by **ground stone tools** and **handmade grey ware**.
  * Upper levels show contact with **metal-using** and **wheel-made pottery** cultures.
> "The North-western Neolithic has two phases. The first phase is marked by a pre-ceramic culture using mud-structures, bone, chert and polished stone tools, and domestication of goat, sheep and cattle. In the second phase hand-made pottery also appears" (Agarwal, 1981).

### Pottery Development
* **Initial Stage**:
  * **Crude**, **hand-made**, and **ill-baked pottery**.
* **Later Stage**:
  * Improved, **well-made**, and **well-baked pottery**.
* **Significance**:
  * Development linked to the **subsistence economy**, requiring storage for **forest and agricultural produce**.
  * Coincides with the invention of the **wheel**.
> "Obviously this was the time when the greatest invention till date i.e. the wheel came into being."

### Broader Context and Cultural Diffusion
* **Challenges**:
  * Absence of **bones** and **implements of the earliest man** limits understanding of **tool-makersâ€™ antecedents**.
* **Cultural Diffusion**:
  * Possible influence from **Central Asia**, **northern China**, and **Afghanistan** during later **Stone Age** phases.
* **Transition to Protohistory**:
  * **Neolithic cultures** overlap with **Chalcolithic urban cultures**, complicating demarcation.
  * **Prehistory**: Lacks written records, relies on **stone implements** for reconstruction.
  * **Protohistory**: Partial written records (undeciphered), as seen in the **Indus Valley Civilization**.
  * **Stone Age man**: Used **symbolic language** and **Palaeolithic art**.
  * **Chalcolithic man**: Continued using **stone implements** but developed **metals** as alternatives.
> "Later neolithic cultures must have been strongly influenced by the contemporary chalcolithic urban cultures and hence the two can not exactly be demarcated from each other."

### Key Terminology
* **Neolithic Age**: Final phase of **stone tool industries**, marked by **grinding and polishing**.
* **Celtanaxe**, **Adze**: Smoothed, rounded tools of the **Neolithic**.
* **Ring stones**, **Mace-heads**, **Pot-sheds**: Tools for processing **agricultural produce**.
* **Coarse grey or black burnished pottery**: Common in **Northern Neolithic**.
* **Bone tools**: **Points**, **awls**, **needles**, **harpoons** in **Burzhom**.
* **Mud-floors**, **Circular huts**: **Neolithic** dwelling structures.
* **Jhooming**: Slash-and-burn cultivation in **Eastern Neolithic**.
* **Hand-made cord-impressed pottery**: Characteristic of **Eastern Neolithic**.
* **Wheel-made pottery**: Advanced pottery in later **Neolithic** phases.
* **Subsistence economy**: Shift from **hunting-gathering** to agriculture and storage.
