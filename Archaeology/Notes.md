# Indian Archaeology

## Introduction
* **Stone Age Cultures** are prehistoric cultures found globally, named for their use of stone tools.
* These cultures are categorized based on the antiquity of finds and the level of technology in tool-making.
* General terminology includes:
  * **Palaeolithic** (Old Stone Age), with subdivisions: **Lower Palaeolithic**, **Middle Palaeolithic**, and **Upper Palaeolithic**.
  * **Mesolithic** (Middle Stone Age).
  * **Neolithic** (New Stone Age).

### Palaeolithic Cultures
**Lower Palaeolithic**
* Associated with **Homo erectus**.
* Characterized by **core-tool tradition**:
  * Tools include crude **hand-axes**, **choppers**, and **chopping tools**.
  * Prepared by **direct percussion**.
* Material: **quartzite**, a coarse material resulting in tools with uneven edges.

**Middle Palaeolithic**
* Generally attributed to **Neanderthals**.
* Characterized by:
  * Abundance of **flakes** and **flake-tools**.
  * Finely-made **hand-axes**.
* Material: **quartzite**, similar to Lower Palaeolithic, lending uneven edges to tools.

**Upper Palaeolithic**
* Specialized in:
  * Advanced **fluting bone tools**.
  * **Palaeolithic Art**, also known as **Cave Art**.

### Mesolithic Cultures
* Represented by:
  * **Blade tools** made from **crypto-crystalline silica** (e.g., **flint**, **chert**, **jasper**, **agate**, **chalcedony**).
  * Techniques: **pressure flaking**, **indirect flaking**, and **prepared core technique**.
* Typical tools:
  * **Shouldered tools (Celts)**, prepared by **grinding and polishing technique**.

### Neolithic Cultures
* Associated with:
  * **Pottery**, found alongside Neolithic tool types.

### Stone Age Cultures in India
**Overview**
* **Lower Palaeolithic** and **Middle Palaeolithic** parallels are found across India.
* Evidence for later cultures (**Upper Palaeolithic** and **Mesolithic**) is less consistent compared to global findings.

**Challenges with Upper Palaeolithic in India**
* **Advanced fluting technique**: Evidence is not conclusive in India.
* **Bone tools**:
  * Characteristic of **Upper Palaeolithic Culture** in Europe but not frequently found in India.
  * Possible reasons:
    * Lack of knowledge about such tools by early humans in India.
    * **Acidic soil** in India may have destroyed bone tools, contributing to the paucity of **fossils of early man**.
> "We must not forget that we have paucity of fossils of early man in India and one main reason given is that Indian soil is more acidic than elsewhere."

**Palaeolithic Art and Microlithic Cultures**
* **Palaeolithic Art** in India:
  * Associated with **microlithic cultures**.
  * Difficult to differentiate between **Upper Palaeolithic** and **Mesolithic microliths** in India.

**Terminology Adjustments in India**
* To address confusion:
  * Parallels of European **Lower Palaeolithic** and **Middle Palaeolithic** were termed **Early Stone Age** and **Middle Stone Age**, respectively.
  * **Upper Palaeolithic-Mesolithic complex** was designated as **Late Stone Age**.
* Recent shift:
  * Indian anthropologists and archaeologists have reverted to the traditional terminology: **Palaeolithic** (**Lower**, **Middle**, **Upper**), **Mesolithic**, and **Neolithic**.

### Key Terminology
* **Stone Age Cultures**: Prehistoric cultures defined by stone tool use.
* **Palaeolithic**: Old Stone Age, subdivided into Lower, Middle, and Upper stages.
* **Mesolithic**: Middle Stone Age, marked by blade tools and advanced techniques.
* **Neolithic**: New Stone Age, associated with pottery.
* **Core-tool tradition**: Crude tools like hand-axes, choppers, and chopping tools.
* **Flake-tools**: Tools made from flakes, prominent in Middle Palaeolithic.
* **Fluting bone tools**: Advanced bone tools of the Upper Palaeolithic.
* **Palaeolithic Art**: Cave art associated with Upper Palaeolithic.
* **Crypto-crystalline silica**: Materials like flint, chert, jasper, agate, and chalcedony used in Mesolithic tools.
* **Pressure flaking**, **Indirect flaking**, **Prepared core technique**: Advanced tool-making methods.
* **Shouldered tools (Celts)**: Mesolithic tools prepared by grinding and polishing.

## Location of Stone Age Cultures

## Introduction
* **Early man** typically inhabited areas close to water sources, influencing the locations where their cultural remains are found.
* Key locations include **ancient rivers**, **lakes**, and, to a lesser extent, **glacier-formed moraines**.

### Primary Locations of Early Human Remains
**River Terraces**
* **Formation**: Rivers create **river terraces** through **erosional activity**.
* **Stratigraphy**:
  * Oldest terraces are located at the **top layer**.
  * Youngest terraces are found at the **bottom layer**.
* **Significance**: Remains of **early human cultures** are commonly found on or within these **river terraces**.

**Lake-Beds**
* **Formation**: **Lake-beds** are formed through **depositional activity**.
* **Stratigraphy**:
  * **Topmost beds** are the youngest.
  * Older beds are located beneath.
* **Significance**: Remains of **early man** are also found in **lake-beds**, reflecting their proximity to water sources.

**Glacial Moraines**
* **Formation**: Formed by the activity of **glaciers**, resulting in **moraines**.
* **Significance in India**:
  * Remains in **moraines** are less useful for reconstructing **ancient cultural history** in India.
> "Remains of early man may also be found in the activity of glaciers (that form morains) but this kind of remains in INDIA don’t help much in the reconstruction of ancient cultural history."

### Key Terminology
* **Early man**: Prehistoric humans associated with **Stone Age cultures**.
* **River terraces**: Landforms created by **erosional activity** of rivers, containing cultural remains.
* **Lake-beds**: Sedimentary deposits formed by **depositional activity**, preserving remains of **early man**.
* **Moraines**: Deposits formed by **glaciers**, less significant for cultural reconstruction in India.
* **Erosional activity**: Process by which rivers shape **terraces** and expose cultural remains.
* **Depositional activity**: Process forming **lake-beds**, with younger layers on top.

  * Southern Hemisphere:
    * Four **rainy seasons** (**pluvials**): **Kageran**, **Kamesian**, and **Gamblian**.
    * Separated by three **dry seasons** (**interpluvials**).

### Impact on Stone Tool Cultures
* **Settlement Patterns**:
  * During **rainy** or **snowy seasons**, early humans resided in **cave-shelters**.
  * During **dry seasons**, they preferred **open-air sites**.
* **Archaeological Evidence**:
  * Remains of **stone-tool cultures** are found in:
    * **Cave shelter sites**.
    * **River terraces**.
> "During the Rainy or Snowy seasons man lived in the cave-shelters while in dry times he preferred to live in the open. Consequently, we find the remains of stone-tool cultures in cave shelter sites or the terraces."

## Lower and Middle Palaeolithic Cultures in India

### Lower Palaeolithic Cultures
**Tool Types and Evolution**
* **Primary Tool**: **Crude hand-axe**, evolving from heavy, crude forms to smaller, finely made, and handy versions.
* Other tools:
  * **Choppers**: Prominent in initial stages.
  * **Cleavers**: Appear in later stages.
  * **Flakes**: Initially a by-product of **core-tools**, later the main focus of tool-makers.
* **Comparison**: Indian **Lower Palaeolithic** tool cultures are comparable to those in **Europe**.

**Regional Variations**
**A. Soan River (Described by de Terra and Paterson)**
* **Upper Terraces** (Older):
  * **Crude, heavy hand-axes** and **chopping tools** made on **pebbles**.
* **Lower Terraces** (Younger):
  * Small, finely worked **hand-axes**, **cleavers**, **discoidal cores**, **flakes**, and **chopping tools**.
* **Late Soan Cultures**:
  * Previously thought to represent **Middle Palaeolithic**, but primarily show a **flake tool industry**.

**B. Beas River (Described by B. B. Lal)**
* **Chopper and chopping tools**:
  * Most abundant in **Punjab**.
  * Decrease in frequency southward, southeast, and southwest.
* Uncertainty:
  * Unclear if **chopping tools** are a local variation or a continuation of **East Asian traditions**.
* **Later Stage**: Frequency of **chopping tools** diminishes significantly.

**C. South India: Madrasian Culture**
* Named after **Attirampakkam** near **Madras**, located on the **Budida Manu Vanka River**.
* **Stratigraphy**:
  * **Uppermost Level**: **Microliths**.
  * **Middle Level**: **Flake tools**.
  * **Lower Level**: **Hand-axes**, **cleavers**, and other **Lower Palaeolithic** tools.
* **Distinction**:
  * Lower proportion of **choppers and chopping tools** compared to **Punjab**.
> "The major difference between Soan and Madrasian cultures is with respect to the occurrence of chopping tools as the proportion of these tools to the total assembly of tools."

**D. Adamgarh Hill (Narmada Valley)**
* **Lower Strata**:
  * **Crude hand-axes**, **chopping tools**, **ovates**, and a few **cleavers**.
* **Higher Strata**:
  * Increased presence of **cleavers** with varied shapes and probable functions.
* **Significance**:
  * Demonstrates **continuity of habitation** and evolution through **indigenous experiences**.

### Materials and Techniques
* **Early Stage**:
  * Tools made from **pebbles**, resulting in rounded shapes.
  * **Bulb of percussion**: Massive, using **direct hammer technique**.
* **Later Stage**:
  * Raw materials shifted to **boulders** and **outcrops of rocks**.
  * More sophisticated techniques employed.
* **Primary Material**:
  * **Quartzite** or **quartzite-pebbles**, abundant in **rock outcrops** and **boulders**.

### Habitation Patterns
* **Cave Use**:
  * Early humans rarely inhabited **caves** during **Lower Palaeolithic** times.
  * At **Gudiyam Cave** near **Madras**:
    * Tools from **Lower**, **Middle**, and **Upper Palaeolithic** found in evolutionary sequence.
    * Small assemblage size limits definitive conclusions.

### Chronology and Cultural Development
* **Emergence**: Tentatively dated to the **early Upper Pleistocene**.
* **Regional Variation**:
  * Areas like **western zones** may represent late colonization.
  * Densely populated regions: **Narmada**, **Krishna**, **Mahanadi**, and **Burhabalang**.
* **Cultural Traditions**:
  * **Abbevillian types**: Intruded into **Acheulian** industries.
  * Evidence of **Late Acheulians** without **Abbevillian indicators**, suggesting distinct stages.
* **Acheulian Tradition**:
  * Younger in India than in **France**.
  * Conservative estimate: **100,000 to 60,000 years ago**.
  * Recent estimate (Current Anthropology, 1992): Earliest **Acheulian** at **350,000 years ago**.
> "A recent article in Current Anthropology (1992) has put the earliest date for Acheulian in India at about 3,50,000 years ago. Thus, to expect a kind of human evolution with cultural association in the line of Olduvai Gorge in India would not be entirely correct."

## Middle Palaeolithic Cultures
### Tool Characteristics

  * Reflects logical **litho-cultural evolution**.
* **Shivna and Main Narmada Valley**:
  * **Middle Palaeolithic** appears exotic due to new **stone age** characteristics.
  * Contrasts with **Bhimbetka’s** continuity.

### Regional and Cultural Variations
* **Mousterian Influence**:
  * Similarities with **Mousterian** industries in **Afghanistan** and **Zagros Mountains**.
  * Estimated chronology by **Bridget Allchin**: **45,000 to 25,000 B.P.**.
* **Local Developments**:
  * **Maharashtrian Karnataka**: Features a **Levallois-based Middle Palaeolithic** with **Mousteroid character**.
  * **Kurnool to Chhattisgarh**:
    * Developed an effective, locally distinct **Middle Palaeolithic**.
    * Emphasis on **borers** over **points**, reducing the prominence of **Levallois technique**.
  * **Andhra and Orissa**:
    * Show differential growth with a focus on **scrapers** and **borers**.
    * **Leaf-shaped points** and **Levallois technique** become less significant.
> "In fact, it becomes difficult to visualize how these scraper and borer dominating tool-kit could be of any use for an actively hunting and gathering population."

### Challenges in Understanding Middle Palaeolithic
* **Later Phase**:
  * Least understood due to overlap with **Upper Palaeolithic** industries.

### Regional Neolithic Cultures
**A. North India: Burzhom (Kashmir)**
* **Chronology**:
  * Dated to **2375 BC**, with the latest tools around **2500 years old**.
* **Cultural Finds**:
  * **Coarse grey or black burnished pottery**.
  * **Bone tools**: **Points**, **awls**, **needles**, **harpoons**.
  * **Stone tools**: **Axes with pointed butts**, **ring stones**, **pierced rectangular choppers or knives**.
* **Cultural Practices**:
  * Evidence of **ceremonial burning of dogs with their masters**, suggesting **religious practices**.
> "Evidence of ceremonial burning of dogs with their masters indicate about some sort of religious practices prevalent among the people."

**B. Peninsular India**
* **Chronology**:
  * Dated between **2300 BC to 1500 BC**.
* **Key Sites**:
  * **Brahmagiri** (Karnataka), **Sangankallu** (Bellary), **Peninsular** (Andhra Pradesh).
* **Tool Types**:
  * Western regions: Emphasis on **blade implements** and **pottery**.
  * Eastern regions: Dominance of **Celts**, **ring stones**, and **grinding stones**.
* **Cultural Indicators**:
  * Evidence of **cultural continuity** and **prolonged settlement**.
  * **Agricultural production** and **cattle-rearing economy**.
  * **Developed human dwellings**: **Mud-floors**, **circular huts** made of **wattle and daub** or **wooden frames**.
* **Metal Use**:
  * **Copper** and **bronze objects** appear toward the close of the **Neolithic age**.

**C. Eastern India**
* **Challenges**:
  * Most findings are **surface finds**, making precise dating difficult.
* **Key Regions**:
  * **Nagaland** and **Brahmaputra Valley**:
    * Unique **quadrangular adzes**, **shouldered hoes**, and **megalithic monuments**.
  * **Bengal, Bihar, Orissa**:
    * Tools include **adzes**, **axes**, **hammer-stones**, **shouldered tools**, and **perforated tools**.
    * **Poor pottery** is common.
* **Agricultural Practices**:
  * Circumstantial evidence of **jhooming** (slash-and-burn cultivation).

### Summary by Agarwal (1981)
* **North-western Neolithic** (e.g., **Kili Ghul Mohammad**, northwest Pakistan):
  * **Phase I**: Pre-ceramic, with **mud-structures**, **bone**, **chert**, **polished stone tools**, and domestication of **goat**, **sheep**, and **cattle**.
  * **Phase II**: Introduction of **hand-made pottery**.
* **Northern Neolithic** (e.g., **Burzhom**):
  * **Period I**: **Hand-made pottery**, **bone**, and **ground stone tools**, with **underground dwelling pits**.
  * **Period II**: Introduction of **metal** and **wheel-made pottery**.
  * No evidence of **domesticated plants and animals** in Period I.
* **Eastern Zone**:
  * Marked by **ground stone artifacts** and **handmade cord-impressed pottery**.
  * Dating is insecure; some artifacts appear in **historical levels**.
  * Variants in **Orissa** and **Bihar** suggest **jhooming**.
* **Southern Neolithic**:
  * Characterized by **ground stone tools** and **handmade grey ware**.
  * Upper levels show contact with **metal-using** and **wheel-made pottery** cultures.
> "The North-western Neolithic has two phases. The first phase is marked by a pre-ceramic culture using mud-structures, bone, chert and polished stone tools, and domestication of goat, sheep and cattle. In the second phase hand-made pottery also appears" (Agarwal, 1981).

### Pottery Development
* **Initial Stage**:
  * **Crude**, **hand-made**, and **ill-baked pottery**.
* **Later Stage**:
  * Improved, **well-made**, and **well-baked pottery**.
* **Significance**:
  * Development linked to the **subsistence economy**, requiring storage for **forest and agricultural produce**.
  * Coincides with the invention of the **wheel**.
> "Obviously this was the time when the greatest invention till date i.e. the wheel came into being."

### Broader Context and Cultural Diffusion
* **Challenges**:
  * Absence of **bones** and **implements of the earliest man** limits understanding of **tool-makers’ antecedents**.
* **Cultural Diffusion**:
  * Possible influence from **Central Asia**, **northern China**, and **Afghanistan** during later **Stone Age** phases.
* **Transition to Protohistory**:
  * **Neolithic cultures** overlap with **Chalcolithic urban cultures**, complicating demarcation.
  * **Prehistory**: Lacks written records, relies on **stone implements** for reconstruction.
  * **Protohistory**: Partial written records (undeciphered), as seen in the **Indus Valley Civilization**.
  * **Stone Age man**: Used **symbolic language** and **Palaeolithic art**.
  * **Chalcolithic man**: Continued using **stone implements** but developed **metals** as alternatives.
> "Later neolithic cultures must have been strongly influenced by the contemporary chalcolithic urban cultures and hence the two can not exactly be demarcated from each other."

### Key Terminology
* **Neolithic Age**: Final phase of **stone tool industries**, marked by **grinding and polishing**.
* **Celtanaxe**, **Adze**: Smoothed, rounded tools of the **Neolithic**.
* **Ring stones**, **Mace-heads**, **Pot-sheds**: Tools for processing **agricultural produce**.
* **Coarse grey or black burnished pottery**: Common in **Northern Neolithic**.
* **Bone tools**: **Points**, **awls**, **needles**, **harpoons** in **Burzhom**.
* **Mud-floors**, **Circular huts**: **Neolithic** dwelling structures.
* **Jhooming**: Slash-and-burn cultivation in **Eastern Neolithic**.
* **Hand-made cord-impressed pottery**: Characteristic of **Eastern Neolithic**.
* **Wheel-made pottery**: Advanced pottery in later **Neolithic** phases.
* **Subsistence economy**: Shift from **hunting-gathering** to agriculture and storage.
