## **Stone Age Cultures: A Global and Indian Perspective**

### **1. General Classification of Stone Age Cultures**

The cultures of early man have been widely found across the world and are collectively termed as **‘Stone Age Cultures’**. These prehistoric cultures are classified based on:

* **Antiquity of the finds**
* **Level of technology used in making stone tools**

The general terminology used:

* **Palaeolithic (Old Stone Age)**
  Subdivided into:
  * *Lower Palaeolithic*
  * *Middle Palaeolithic*
  * *Upper Palaeolithic*
* **Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age)**
* **Neolithic (New Stone Age)**

### **2. Characteristics of Major Stone Age Cultures**

#### **a. Lower Palaeolithic**

* Associated with: **Homo erectus**
* Tool Types:
  1. **Crude hand-axes**
  2. **Choppers**
  3. **Chopping tools**
* Technique: **Direct percussion**
* Tradition: **Core-tool tradition**

#### **b. Middle Palaeolithic**

* Generally attributed to: **Neanderthals**
* Tool Characteristics:
  * Abundance of **flakes** and **flake-tools**
  * **Finely-made hand-axes**
* Material: Typically **quartzite**
  * Crude and coarse
  * Produced tools with **uneven edges**

#### **c. Upper Palaeolithic**

* Specialized Features:
  * **Advanced fluting bone tools**
  * **Palaeolithic Art** (also called **Cave Art**)

#### **d. Mesolithic**

* Tool Characteristics:
  * **Blade tools** made of **crypto-crystalline silica** such as:
    * Flint
    * Chert
    * Jasper
    * Agate
    * Chalcedony
  * Techniques:
    * **Pressure flaking**
    * **Indirect flaking**
    * **Prepared core technique**

#### **e. Neolithic**

* Tools:
  * **Shouldered tools (Celts)** prepared by **grinding and polishing**
* Associated Artifacts:
  * **Pottery**

### **3. Indian Context: Deviations and Terminology**

#### **a. Early Finds and Tool Parallels**

* **Lower and Middle Palaeolithic parallels** found throughout India.
* However:
  * Evidence of **advanced fluting technique** is **not conclusive**.
  * **Bone tools** (typical of European Upper Palaeolithic) are **rare**.

> *It is not known whether early man in India did not produce these tools because he did not know their use, or whether the acidic soil of India destroyed them.*

* **Lack of fossil evidence** in India is often attributed to **acidic soil**, which may have deteriorated both **fossils** and **bone tools**.

#### **b. Palaeolithic Art and Cultural Overlap**

* **Palaeolithic Art**, typically a marker of Upper Palaeolithic in Europe, is found in India with **microlithic cultures**.
* This overlap makes it difficult to differentiate between:
  * **Indian Upper Palaeolithic**
  * **Mesolithic microliths**

#### **c. Terminology Shift for Indian Context**

* To reduce confusion, Indian archaeological terminology had diverged:
  * **Early Stone Age** = European *Lower Palaeolithic*
  * **Middle Stone Age** = European *Middle Palaeolithic*
  * **Late Stone Age** = *Upper Palaeolithic-Mesolithic complex*
* **Recent Trend**: Return to **traditional terminology** for Indian finds:
  * **Palaeolithic (Lower, Middle, Upper)**
  * **Mesolithic**
  * **Neolithic**

## **Location of Stone Age Cultures**

### **1. Settlement Pattern of Early Man**

* **Early man generally lived near sources of water.**
* Remains of early human cultures are usually found:
  * **On or near ancient rivers**
  * **Along ancient lakes**

### **2. River Terraces and Human Remains**

* **Rivers**, through **erosional activity**, form **river terraces**.
* Characteristics of river terraces:

  * Remains of early human cultures are found **on or within these terraces**.
  * In a cross-section of a river:
    * The **oldest terraces** form the **top layer**.
    * The **youngest terraces** are at the **bottom**.

### **3. Lake Beds and Human Remains**

* **Lakes**, through **depositional activity**, create **lake beds**.
* Stratification in lake beds:
  * The **topmost beds** are the **youngest**.

### **4. Glacial Activity and Cultural Remains**

* Remains of early man may also be found in:
  * **Morains** formed by **glacial activity**.
* However:

  > "This kind of remains in INDIA don’t help much in the reconstruction of ancient cultural history."

## **Climatic Changes and Stone Tool Cultures**

### **1. Geological Time Scale Overview**

The entire history of the Earth is divided into several **Eras**, each marked by distinct stages of life development:
* **Azoic** – *Without life*
* **Archeozoic** – *Primitive life*
* **Proterozoic** – *Precursors of advanced life*
* **Paleozoic** – *Age of fishes*
* **Mesozoic** – *Age of reptiles, dinosaurs*
* **Caenozoic** – *Age of mammals*

#### **Caenozoic Period Subdivisions**

The **Caenozoic Era** is further divided into several periods:
* **Paleocene**
* **Eocene** – *(Development of primitive primates)*
* **Oligocene**
* **Miocene**
* **Pliocene** – *(Development of higher primates)*
* **Pleistocene** – *(Birth of genus *Homo*)*
* **Holocene** – *(The most recent period, currently in progress)*

---

### **2. The Pleistocene Epoch and Climatic Shifts**
* Time Span: Approximately **2.5 million years** before the Holocene.
* Marked by: **Sudden and frequent climatic changes**.

#### **Northern Hemisphere: Glacial Activity**

The Pleistocene featured **four glacial phases** and **three interglacial periods**:

* **Glacial Phases:**
  * **Gunz** (First)
  * **Mindel** (Second)
  * **Riss** (Third)
  * **Wurm** (Fourth)
* **Interglacial Periods:**
  * **Gunz-Mindel**
  * **Mindel-Riss**
  * **Riss-Wurm**

#### **Southern Hemisphere: Rainfall Patterns**

* Alternating between **four rainy seasons (pluvials)** and **three dry seasons (interpluvials)**:
  * **Pluvials:**
    * **Kageran**
    * **Kamesian**
    * **Gamblian**
  * **Interpluvials:**
    * Three unnamed dry intervals between the pluvials

---

### **3. Impact on Human Habitation and Stone Tool Cultures**

* **Habitation Patterns:**
  * During **rainy or snowy seasons**, early man **lived in cave-shelters**.
  * During **dry seasons**, he **preferred open living**.

> *“Consequently, we find the remains of stone-tool cultures in cave shelter sites or the terraces.”*

---

## **Palaeolithic Cultures**

### **1. Archaeological Site Evidence in India**

* **Hundreds of Stone Age culture sites** have been identified across India.
* However, **most sites do not have tools found *in situ*** (i.e., in their original position).
* Only two sites exhibit **almost continuous stages of cultural evolution**:

  * **Bhimbetka**
  * **The Narmada Valley**

#### **Nature of Most Finds**

* Predominantly **surface finds** (tools not buried or stratified).
* As a result, **exact dating is difficult**.
* However, these finds can be **classified based on changes in tool typology**.

---

### **2. Fossil Record and Cultural Creators**

* To date, only **one human fossil** has been found:

  * **Homo sapiens fossil** from the **Narmada Valley**
* Apart from this single specimen:

  > *“We feel handicapped regarding the antecedents of the creators of stone tool traditions in India.”*

---

### **3. Historical Background of Discoveries**

* **Earliest recorded finds in India:**

  * **1842**, by **Dr. Primrose**
  * Discovered a **bagful of stone knives and arrow-heads** while clearing his garden in **Raichur**

* **First reliable published account:**

  * **1853**, by **John Evans**
  * Documented **worked flints** found along the **Narmada River near Jabalpur**

## Lower and Middle Palaeolithic Cultures in India

### 1. Lower Palaeolithic Cultures

#### Tool Types and Evolution

* **Hand-axe**: Most common early Stone Age tool; evolved from heavy, crude forms to smaller, refined versions.
* **Choppers and Cleavers**: Found in early stages (choppers) and later stages (cleavers).
* **Flakes**:
  * Initially a by-product of tool-making.
  * Eventually became the main tool objective.
* Tools comparable to European Lower Palaeolithic industries.

#### Site-Specific Sequences

* **Soan River (De Terra and Paterson)**:
  * Upper terraces: crude, heavy hand-axes, chopping tools on pebbles.
  * Lower terraces: small, finely worked hand-axes, cleavers, discoidal cores, flakes, chopping tools.
  * Late Soan culture: flake tool industry.
* **Beas River (B. B. Lal)**:
  * Choppers and chopping tools abundant in Punjab.
  * Frequency decreases moving south, southeast, and southwest.
  * Chopping tools possibly regional variation or continuation from East Asia.
* **South India (Madrasian Culture)**:
  * Named after Attirampakkam site near Madras on Budida Manu Vanka river.
  * Stratigraphy: microliths (topmost), flake tools (middle), hand-axes & cleavers (bottom).
  * Difference with Soan culture: High frequency of choppers in Punjab not matched elsewhere.
* **Adamgarh Hill (Narmada Valley)**:
  * Lower strata: crude hand-axes, chopping tools, ovates, few cleavers.
  * Higher strata: greater variety and number of cleavers.

#### Tool Making Techniques

* Early tools: made from rounded pebbles.
* Later tools: made from boulders and rock outcrops.
* Bulb of percussion: massive initially (direct hammer technique); became more refined over time.
* Raw material: quartzite and quartzite pebbles.

#### Habitation Patterns

* Caves were rarely inhabited in Lower Palaeolithic.
* **Gudiyam Cave (near Madras)**: yielded Lower, Middle, and Upper Palaeolithic tools, but small assemblage.

#### Chronology and Regional Variation

* Emergence: Early Upper Pleistocene.
* Not universal across subcontinent; Western zones possibly colonized later.
* **Densely populated regions**: Narmada, Krishna, Mahanadi, Burhabalang.
* Cultural metamorphosis:
  * **Abbevillian types** intruded into **Acheulian**.
  * Late Acheulians found without Abbevillian indicators.
  * Acheulian tools in India: younger than French ones.

> "A very conservative estimation for \[Acheulian] should be anywhere between 100,000 to 60,000 years ago. However, a recent article in *Current Anthropology (1992)* has put the earliest date for Acheulian in India at about 3,50,000 years ago."

* Conclusion: Human evolution with cultural association like Olduvai Gorge is not entirely applicable to India.

---

### 2. Middle Palaeolithic Cultures

#### Tool Characteristics

* **Core-Flake Technology**:
  * Flakes removed from prepared core.
  * Material: crypto-crystalline silica (smooth surface, regular conchoidal fracture).
* **Tool Types**:
  * Round, rectangular, pointed flakes.
  * Parallel-sided blade-flakes with pronounced percussion.
  * Occasional small, rounded hand-axes.
  * Upper gravels: associated with flake tools and cores.
  * **Pandar Falls** (Central India): typical site.

#### Regional Industries

* **Sanghao** (frontiers of Indian subcontinent):
  * Cave site; tools made from local quartz.
  * Comparable to other regional tools.
* **Wainganga (Upper B)**:
  * Later Middle Palaeolithic phase.
  * Tools: flake-blades, burins, tanged and shouldered points.

#### Chronological Gaps and Stratigraphy

* Early industries found in stratified gravels.
* Later Middle Palaeolithic industries: not well stratified.

#### Cultural Understanding and Variants

* Overall status remains inadequately understood due to lack of primary habitational sites.
* **Bhimbetka** (Narmada zone):
  * Classically Mousteroid industry.
  * Developed from Upper Acheulian base.
  * Shows litho-cultural evolution.
* **Shivna & Main Narmada Valley**:
  * Middle Palaeolithic appears exotic.
  * Region influenced by new Stone Age.
* **Mousterian Comparisons**:
  * Afghanistan & Zagros Mountains: similar to desert Middle Palaeolithic.
  * **Bridget Allchin**: dates desert Middle Palaeolithic to **45,000–25,000 B.P.**

#### Regional Variants

* **Maharashtra-Karnataka**:
  * Levalloise-based, Mousteroid.
* **Kurnool to Chhattisgarh**:
  * Local development.
* **Narmada**:
  * Two Middle Palaeolithic types:
    * Bhimbetka: Mousteroid (same raw material).
    * Shivna-Damoh: changed raw material, includes handaxes and cleavers.
* **Andhra & Orissa**:
  * Differential growth.
  * Emphasis on borers; points become peripheral.
  * Fewer good points; scraper and borer dominance.

> "It becomes difficult to visualize how these scraper and borer dominating tool-kit could be of any use for an actively hunting and gathering population."

* **Sankalia's Proposal**:

  > "Most of the Middle Palaeolithic industry in India was probably designed to shape ultimate weapons of hunting and trapping in wood, bone and antler."

---

## **Upper Palaeolithic Cultures**

### **1. General Characterization**

---

### 3. **Summary by Agarwal (1981)**

> **Agarwal (1981)** summarized Indian Neolithic as follows:

#### **i. North-western Neolithic (e.g., Kili Ghul Mohammad, NW Pakistan)**

* **Two phases**:
  1. **Pre-ceramic culture**:
     * Mud structures
     * Bone, chert, polished stone tools
     * Domesticated goat, sheep, cattle
  2. **Introduction of hand-made pottery**

#### **ii. Northern Neolithic (e.g., Burzhom)**

* **Two periods**:
  * Hand-made pottery
  * Bone and ground stone tools
  * **Metal and wheel-made pottery** in Period II
  * Period I: **underground dwelling pits**
  * No evidence of **domesticated plants/animals**

#### **iii. Eastern Neolithic**

* **Ground stone artifacts**
* **Handmade cord-impressed pottery**
* Dating is **uncertain**
* Tools may appear in **historical contexts**
* Evidence of **jhooming** (slash-and-burn cultivation)
* Variants in **Orissa and Bihar**

#### **iv. Southern Neolithic**

* **Ground stone tools**
* **Handmade grey ware**
* Later layers show **contact with metal cultures** using **wheel-made pottery**

---

### 4. **Economic Changes and Pottery Development**

* Shift from **hunting-fishing-gathering** to **subsistence agriculture**.
* Emergence of **storage needs** led to invention of **earthen pots**:
  * Early pottery: **crude, hand-made, ill-baked**
  * Later pottery: **well-made, well-baked**
* Likely period of the **invention of the wheel**

---

### 5. **Evolution and Cultural Diffusion**

* Excavations (e.g., in **Narmada basin**) show:
  * Gradual evolution from **large crude tools** to **smaller, refined tools**
* **Lack of earliest human bones/implements** in India limits conclusions.
* Possible **cultural diffusion** from:
  * **Central Asia**
  * **Northern China**
  * **Afghanistan**
* Later Neolithic likely influenced by:
  * **Contemporary Chalcolithic urban cultures**
  * **Indistinct boundaries** between Neolithic and Chalcolithic

---

### 6. **Transition from Prehistory to Protohistory**

> "So far we have been dealing with ‘prehistory’ i.e. the account of the period in the evolutionary history of mankind in which the written records are not available."

* Reconstruction is based on:
  * **Stone implements** (due to their durability)
* Next stage is **protohistory**:
  * Written records exist but **language undeciphered**
  * Example: **Indus Valley Civilization**

> "The Stone Age man had only a symbolic language and he explained himself through palaeolithic art... The Chalcolithic man in India had much more developed himself but who continues the use of stone implements while developing metals as their alternative..."
