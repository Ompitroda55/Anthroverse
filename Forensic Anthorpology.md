## **FORMS AND FRAMEWORK OF FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGY**

### **1. Disciplinary Development**
* **Forensic Anthropology** is an **applied discipline**.
* It has made significant **progress since its formal establishment in 1972**.
* Today, it is recognized as a **full-fledged discipline**.

### **2. Theoretical Connection**
* Despite its applied nature, Forensic Anthropology **cannot be separated from the theoretical framework of Physical Anthropology**.

### **3. Challenges in Acceptance**
* Even with the **improvisation of the latest technology**, the discipline faces hurdles:
  * The **role of forensic anthropologists** has **not been fully understood**.
  * There is **limited acceptance** by:
    * The **community of medico-legal professionals**.
    * To some extent, even by **anthropologists** themselves.

## **Definition of Forensic Anthropology**

### **1. Key Definitions**

* **C.C. Snow (1973)** defines Forensic Anthropology as:  
  > "the application of physical anthropologists' specialised knowledge of human sexual, racial, age and individual variation to the problems of medical jurisprudence".

* **Ted Stewart (1979)** offers a complementary definition:  
  > "the branch of physical anthropology which, for forensic purposes, deals with the identification of more or less skeletonized remains known to be, or suspected of being, human. Beyond the elimination of non-human elements, the identification process undertakes to provide opinions regarding sex, age, race, stature and similar other characteristics of each individual involved as may lead to his or her recognition".

### **2. Scope According to Definitions**

* Forensic Anthropologists study both:
  * **Osteological aspects** (related to bones)
  * **Non-osteological aspects** (other biological traits)

* Their work involves analyzing human biological variations relevant to medico-legal contexts, including:
  * **Human growth and development**
  * **Genetics**
  * **Physiological adaptations**
  * **Biomechanics**

* These areas fall **within the purview of physical anthropology** and are considered of **medico-legal importance**.

## **AIMS AND SCOPE OF FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGY**

### **1. Role and Responsibility of Forensic Anthropologists**

* **Forensic identification** entails a **legal obligation** for experts to assist in the identification of **unexpected deaths**.
* This obligation is fulfilled through:
  * Filing a **detailed report** of the case examination.
  * **Testifying in court** as an **expert witness**.

> *“An explanation of the role of expert witness is important for understanding the precise manner of handling of skeletal material recovered from the scene of crime.”*

### **2. Handling of Skeletal Material**

When examining bones recovered from a crime scene, a forensic anthropologist is expected to:

* **Distinguish** between:
  * **Human** and **non-human (animal)** remains.
* Determine:
  * Whether bones have been **altered by fire**.
  * Clues related to the **cause of death**.
  * Estimate the **time since death**.
* Proceed to examine:
  * **Specific identification traits**.

> *“Identification of the skeletal material is the most crucial aspect in such cases...”*

### **3. Knowledge Requirements**

The specialist must possess thorough knowledge in:

* **Comparative anatomy**, including:
  * **Osteology**
  * **Osteometry**
  * **Craniometry**
* **Racial morphology**

### **4. Evolution of the Discipline**

* Forensic Anthropology has evolved to:
  * **Systematize** the **multifactorial problem** of human skeletal reconstruction.
  * Incorporate new dimensions by analyzing the **specific manifestations** on skeletal remains caused by the **nature of death**.

## **TYPES OF DEATH IN FORENSIC CONTEXT**

According to forensic experts, deaths are classified into three types:

1. **Natural**
2. **Accidental**
3. **Intentional**

### **1. Natural Deaths**
* Less significant from a forensic investigation standpoint.
* Focus is on:
  * **Pathological causes of disease**
  * **Bone deformities**
  * **Anatomical abnormalities**

### **2. Accidental Deaths**
* Examples:
  * **Train mishaps**
  * **Air crashes**
  * **Road accidents**
  * **Natural calamities** (e.g., **earthquakes**, **typhoons**)
* Forensic observations on large numbers of remains with **common skeletal manifestations** help experts:
  * **Formulate conclusions** regarding the **source of disaster**.

### **3. Intentional Deaths**
* Includes:
  * **Homicide**
  * **Suicide**
* Most important from a **forensic perspective**.
* **Main aim** of the forensic anthropologist:
  * To **establish the identity** of the deceased individual.

## **FUNCTIONS OF FORENSIC SCIENTISTS**

### **1. Importance of Human Remains**

* **Forensic scientists** recognize that **dead persons and human skeletons contain a wealth of information**.
* However, the process of **postmortem injuries** and **body decomposition** can:
  * **Alter the general appearance**.
  * Obscure **important identifying features**.
  * Make **visual recognition impossible**, even by close relatives or friends.

### **2. Challenges in Identification**

* **Decomposition** complicates common identification methods due to **natural putrefactive processes**.
* As a result, standard visual and physical identifiers may no longer be reliable.

### **3. Classification of Identification Problems**

According to **Mani (1984)**, the **problems of identification** can be categorized into four groups:

1. **Recently dead persons**
2. **Decomposed or mutilated bodies**
3. **Skeletal remains**
4. **Fragmentary remains**

## **PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION THROUGH FINGERPRINTS**

### **Overview**
* Identification of recently dead persons or partly decomposed bodies is generally performed by medical scientists.
* Forensic anthropologists also play a crucial role in identity establishment (Nath, 1989).
* Human morphological characteristics, especially **fingerprints**, are crucial in confirming identity beyond doubt.

### **Time of Formation of Fingerprints**
* Fingerprints refer to ridge patterning on the anterior surface of the fingers.
* Defined as a reproduction of friction ridges on a surface.
* Ridge development timeline:
  * Begins between the **12th and 16th week** of embryonic development.
  * Completed by the **24th week (6th fetal month)**.
* Once formed, ridge patterns remain unchanged for life, unless destroyed by skin decomposition after death.

### **Types of Fingerprints at Crime Scenes**

**1. Visible Prints**
* Clearly visible to the naked eye.
* Created when fingers are contaminated with materials like:
  * Blood
  * Ink
  * Paint
  * Dirt
* Captured via photography for record and comparison.

**2. Plastic Prints**
* Left on soft, moldable surfaces such as:
  * Wax
  * Soft putty
  * Soap
  * Butter
  * Tar
  * Grease
* Photographed directly using direct or side lighting.

**3. Latent Prints**
* Invisible to the naked eye.
* Formed by sweat residue left on surfaces by dermal ridges.
* Found on both porous and non-porous surfaces.

### **Location of Latent Prints**
* Detection is difficult and requires specific techniques depending on surface type.
* **Non-porous surfaces**: glass, metal, polished wood, plastic, painted surfaces, light bulbs, leather, etc.
* **Porous surfaces**: paper, cardboard, unfinished wood.
* **Unusual sources**: textiles, plastered walls, fruit peelings, shoes, guns, shell casings (Nath, 1984).

### **Development of Latent Prints**
* Objective: **Make latent prints visible** for comparison and preservation.
* Scene of crime objects suspected of being touched are carefully examined.

#### **Powder Method**
* Commonly used powders: **black or grey**, selected based on contrast.
* Powder adheres to sweat residue, revealing the print.
* Developed print is photographed.

**Chemical Methods**
* Use of reagents that react with sweat components.
* Sweat contains:
  * 98% water
  * Salts (sodium, potassium chlorides)
  * Sulphates, phosphates, carbonates
  * Calcium, lactic acid, fatty acids, glucose
  * Urea, albumen, amino acids

**Chemicals used for development:**
1. Iodine fumes
2. Silver Nitrate
3. Ninhydrin
4. Osmium Tetraoxide
5. Hydrofluoric Acid
6. Tannic Acid
7. Osmic Acid
8. Mercuric Iodide
9. Bromine
10. Fleming's Reagent
11. Reducing Agents

* All developed prints are photographed for comparison.

### **Fingerprint Comparison and Identity Establishment**
* Fingerprint identity is based on the **permanency and uniqueness** of ridge characteristics.
* **First All India Forensic Science Congress (1973)** resolution:
  * **Minimum 8 matching ridge characteristics** for positive identity.
  * **6-7 points** may allow a qualified expert opinion.

**Common Ridge Characteristics (Minutiae):**
1. Ridge ending or termination
2. Bifurcation
3. Convergence
4. Fork (rightward and leftward)
5. Spur (upward, downward, rightward, leftward)
6. Enclosure
7. Lake formation
8. Deviated break
9. Natural break
10. Interjunction
11. Ridge fragment
12. Point
13. Intersection
14. Change-over
15. Ridge return
16. Angle formation
17. Trifurcation

* Each print may have **75 to 150 ridge characteristics**.
* Identity is confirmed when ridge type and relative placement match in both questioned and suspect prints.
* If they differ, the prints are from different individuals.

### **Importance and Applications of Fingerprints**
* Fingerprints are considered a **vital contribution** of science to law enforcement due to their permanence.

**Common Uses of Fingerprints:**
1. Criminal identification at crime scenes
2. Fugitive identification
3. Criminal info exchange with foreign bureaus
4. Equitable sentencing in courts
5. Maintenance of service/criminal identity records
6. Identification of unknown deceased
7. Recognition of honoured dead by government
8. Identification of amnesia patients
9. Mass disaster victim identification
10. Prevention of hospital misidentification of newborns
11. Locating missing persons
12. Licensing for vehicles, firearms, aircraft
13. Identifying unconscious persons
14. Resolving mistaken identity cases
15. Kidnapping-related identification
16. Bank forgery detection
17. Impersonation identification

* **Effective only when fingerprint records are available**.
* In absence of records, establishing identity is extremely difficult, especially in cases involving skin preservation.
