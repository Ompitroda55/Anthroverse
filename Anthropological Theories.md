# **EVOLUTIONISM**

### **Overview of Early Anthropological Thought**

* In the early years of anthropology, a dominant belief was that **culture evolves in a uniform and progressive manner**.
* It was widely thought that **most societies pass through the same series of stages**, eventually reaching a **common endpoint**.
* This perspective is known as:
  * The **Evolutionary School of thought** (general term)
  * **Classical or 19th century cultural evolutionism** (specific term)

### **Historical Context**

* This school of thought **emerged during the rise of Charles Darwin’s theory of Organic Evolution**, particularly after the publication of his influential book:
  > *Origin of Species* (1859)
* Darwin’s work was gaining widespread popularity during the same period that cultural evolutionism was being developed.

### **Debate on Darwin’s Influence**

* The **simultaneous rise of Darwinism and cultural evolutionism** led to **confusion among scholars** about whether Darwin’s ideas influenced the latter.
* However, scholarly opinions differ on this matter.

**Taggart’s Position**
* **Taggart** firmly opposes the idea that Darwin had a significant influence on cultural evolutionism.
  > "Darwin’s book *Origin of Species*, which appeared in 1859, was too late to cast hardly an influence upon the evolutionary schemes of cultural evolutionism."
* He notes that the **major writings** of prominent 19th-century cultural evolutionists such as:
  * **E.B. Tylor**
  * **Lewis Henry Morgan**
  were published between **1861 and 1865**.
* This suggests that:
  * The **scheme of cultural evolutionism** was being **planned and formulated concurrently** with Darwin’s own research and writing.
  * Therefore, **cultural evolutionism likely developed independently** of Darwin’s direct influence.

## **WHAT IS EVOLUTION**

### **Definition**

* **Evolution** is defined as: A process in which different forms are produced or developed in an orderly manner within a system.
* It involves:
  * **Continuous progress** within a system
  * Transformation such as:
    * **Simplicity → Complexity**
    * **Homogeneity → Heterogeneity**
    * **Uncertainty → Certainty**

### **Application in Anthropology**

* **Evolutionists** have employed evolution as a **methodology** to **reconstruct the history of mankind**.

### **Dimensions of Evolution in Human Beings**

Evolution can be viewed through two primary dimensions:

1. **Biological or Organic Evolution**
2. **Cultural Evolution**

---

## **Evolutionary School of Anthropological Thought**

### **Main Divisions**

The **Evolutionary School of Thought** can be categorized into two broad groups based on the *old* and *new* doctrines of **Cultural Evolution**:

1. **Classical Evolutionary School**
2. **Neo-Evolutionary School**

### **1. Classical Evolutionary School**

This school is further divided into **three sub-schools** based on national tradition:

**a. British Evolutionary School Pioneers:**
* **E.B. Tylor**
* **H.J.S. Maine**
* **J.F. McLennan**
* **S.J.G. Frazer**

**b. American Evolutionary School Pioneer:**

* **L.H. Morgan**

**c. German Evolutionary School Pioneers:**

* **J.J. Bachofen**
* **A. Bastian**

### **2. Neo-Evolutionary School**

This school is divided into **two sub-categories** based on nationality:

**a. British School**

* **V. G. Childe**
**b. American School**

* **Leslie A. White**
* **Julian H. Steward**

---

## **Classical Evolutionary School (19th Century Evolutionists)**

### **Basic Assumptions**

**1. Unilinear Cultural Evolution**

* This evolutionary framework **postulates** that:

  > *Culture or cultures of the world pass through different successive developmental stages in a unilinear fashion.*

**2. Direction of Evolution**

* The **evolutionary direction** is consistently:

  * From **simple → complex**
  * From **similarity → dissimilarity**
  * From **indefinite → definite**

**3. Cultural Parallels and Similarities**

* The theory **asserts** that:

  > *Genuine cultural parallels or cultural similarities developed independently in all cultures in historical sequences.*

* These **cultural parallels** are explained by two primary assumptions:

  * **Man’s ability to invent** new things and ideas
  * The concept of **Psychic Unity of Mankind**

---

## **Psychic Unity of Mankind**

### **The Puzzle of Cultural Similarities**

Evolutionists faced a significant challenge in explaining:

> *The similarities found in culture traits, culture complexes, and culture patterns among people in different parts of the world with no known historical connections.*

**Examples of Simultaneous Cultural Developments**

* **Invention of agriculture** occurred simultaneously in:
  * **South-East Asia**
  * **South-West Asia**
  * **America**
* **Use of zero** was invented independently in:
  * **India**
  * **Babylonia**
  * **Maya civilization**

### **Possible Explanations**

Evolutionists proposed two primary explanations for such similarities:

1. **Independent Invention**
2. **Diffusion**

* However, they found the **theory of diffusion** unconvincing.
* Therefore, they favored the idea of **independent, parallel inventions or discoveries** as the likely cause.

### **Cultural Parallels (Cultural Parallelism)**

* The **ideologies of evolutionists** led to the identification of:

  > *Cultural Parallels*, also termed **Cultural Parallelism** or \**Cultural Similarism*.

* These parallels are explained as outcomes of **similar inventive capacities and mental responses** in humans across different regions.

### **The Concept of Psychic Unity**

* Evolutionists further **postulated** that these cultural parallels were due to the concept of:

  > **Psychic Unity of Mankind**

* This refers to:

  > *A similar mental state among all human beings, leading them to react similarly in like environmental situations during the same historical period.*

**Role in Cultural Evolution**

* Due to **Psychic Unity**, humans across the globe passed through similar cultural stages:

  * **Savagery**
  * **Barbarism**
  * **Civilization**

* The above examples (agriculture, zero) serve as **evidence** for this shared mental capacity.

### **Conclusion**

> *Classical evolutionists postulated that all cultures began with similar, simple cultural traits, which gradually developed into more complex forms through cultural evolution.*

## **Salient Features of Classical Evolutionism**

1. **Unilinear Cultural Evolution**
   * Human culture as a whole—and socio-cultural institutions in particular—**evolve in a unilinear manner**, progressing **stage after stage** through a fixed sequence.
2. **Direction of Cultural Evolution**
   * Evolution follows a consistent direction:
     * From **simple → complex**
     * From **homogeneity → heterogeneity**
     * From **indefinite → definite**
3. **Historical Basis of Stages**
   * The classification of different **stages of cultural development** was based on:
     * **Historical explanations**
     * Methods such as:
       * **Museuology**
       * **Comparative method**
4. **Explanation of Cultural Similarities**
   * **Similarities in cultural traits or complexes** across societies were attributed to:
     * **Parallel inventions**
     * The concept of **Psychic Unity of Mankind**
5. **Concept of Survivals**
   * **Survivals** serve as **evidence of earlier cultural conditions**, found in both:
     * **Material aspects**
     * **Non-material aspects** of culture
   * Definition:
     > *Survivals are processes, customs, and opinions that persist by force of habit, even when they lose their utility.*

## **General Contribution of Classical Evolutionists**

### **1. Application of Evolutionary Schemes**

* Classical Evolutionists used **evolutionary schemes as a methodology** to:
  * **Reconstruct the cultural growth of mankind as a whole**
  * **Establish unilinear developmental sequences**
  * **Generalize cultural phenomena**
* They also sought to:
  * Identify the **developmental sequences of specific cultural institutions** such as:
    * **Marriage**
    * **Family**

### **2. Use of the Comparative Method**

* To support their theoretical frameworks, they applied the **comparative method**:
  * Compared **primitive peoples** with **civilized societies**
  * Concluded that:
    > *Primitive societies reflected the early developmental stages of civilized ones*
* They also:
  * Examined **"survivals"**—traits from earlier stages of culture that persisted over time
  * Treated **survivals** as **indicators of the cultural conditions of earlier periods**

> This approach—**comparing worldwide cultures or cultural institutions**—is known as the
> **Comparative Method of Cultural Evolutionists**.

## **Contribution of Classical Evolutionists**

### **Application of Evolutionary Schemes**

* **Classical Evolutionists** applied **evolutionary schemes** to:
  * Reconstruct the **developmental stages of human culture** as a whole
  * Analyze the evolution of **specific cultural institutions**, including:
    * **Marriage**
    * **Family**
    * **Kinship**
    * **Religion**
* Their methodological foundation was the **comparative method**.

### **Cultural Evolution Theory**

**Tylor and Morgan's Postulation**

* Both **E.B. Tylor** and **L.H. Morgan** theorized that:

  > *Mankind as a whole has passed through the stages of **Savagery**, **Barbarism**, and **Civilization**.*

**Tylor's Contribution**

* **Tylor** did **not classify specific cultures** into these stages.
* He emphasized the general **unilinear progression** of culture.

**Morgan's Contribution**

* **Morgan** offered a **more detailed classification**, dividing the stages as follows:
  * **Savagery**: Lower, Middle, Upper
  * **Barbarism**: Lower, Middle, Upper

**Ethnic Period Classification by Morgan**

* Morgan's classification of **Savagery**, **Barbarism**, and **Civilization** corresponds to what anthropologists today refer to as:
  * **Hunting & food-gathering societies** (Savagery)
  * **Horticulturalists** (Barbarism)
  * **Pre-state or proto-state societies** (Civilization)

---

## **Institutional Evolution**

### **Focus of Classical Evolutionists**

* Classical evolutionists sought to **establish historical sequences** in the development of:
  * **Marriage**
  * **Family**
  * **Kinship**

### **Marriage Evolution**

* According to **Tylor**, **Morgan**, **McLennan**, **Bachofen**, and **Bastian**:
  > *Sexual promiscuity was the earliest stage of marriage.*
* The **evolutionary sequence of marriage** progressed through:
  1. **Sexual promiscuity**
  2. **Group marriage**
  3. **Polyandry**
  4. **Monogamy** (as the most developed form)

### **Family and Societal Structure Evolution**

* These scholars believed that early societies were:
  * **Matriarchal**
  * **Matrilineal**
  * **Matrilocal**
* Over time, these gave rise to:
  * **Patriarchal**
  * **Patrilineal**
  * **Patrilocal** societies
* **Exception – H.J.S. Maine**:
  * Contrary to the others, **Maine** proposed that:
    > *Patriarchy was the original form of family, which later evolved into matriarchy.*

### **Morgan's Contribution to Family Evolution**

* **L.H. Morgan** suggested a sequence of **fifteen successive stages** in the development of the **family**.
  * **Earliest stage**: **Consanguineal family**
  * **Most developed stage**: **Monogamous family**

### **Kinship Terminology Evolution**

* According to Morgan:
  * The **classificatory system** of kinship was the **early stage**
  * It was eventually replaced by the more specific **descriptive system**

## **Evaluation of Classical Evolutionary Scheme**

### **Criticism and Enduring Value**

* **Classical evolutionists** were criticized by:
  * **Particularists**
  * **Diffusionists**
  * **Migrationists**

> These critics **discredited the fundamental postulates** of the evolutionists based on empirical findings.

* **Despite the criticism**, classical evolutionists were:
  > *The first and foremost thinkers to contribute a **theoretical foundation** to anthropology.*
* Their ideas:
  * **Laid the foundation** of anthropological thought
  * **Paved the way** for future research and theoretical development

### **View on Primitive Societies**

* Evolutionists believed:
  > *Primitive or tribal societies were the ancestors of modern civilized societies.*

* This perspective suggested:
  * **Primitives represented early stages** of human social development
  * **Civilized societies evolved** from these early forms

> This idea **challenged the concept of racial superiority**, even though evolutionists were **often labeled ethnocentric**.

### **Methodological Contributions**

**Challenges Faced**

* Due to the **absence of written records**, establishing the evolution of cultural aspects was difficult.

**Strategies Used**

* Used **critical and analytical thinking** to:
  * **Reconstruct cultural history of mankind**
* Drew from:
  * **Extensive existing literature**—left by:
    * **Travellers**
    * **Missionaries**
    * **Ethnographers**
* Where records were lacking, they applied:
  * The concept of **cultural survivals** to bridge **missing historical links**

**Comparative Use of Survivals**

* Compared both **material and non-material survivals** to:
  * Establish developmental sequences:
    * From **simple → complex**
    * From **homogeneity → heterogeneity**
    * From **uncertainty → certainty**

### **Lasting Influence**

* The **historical and comparative approach** introduced by classical evolutionists:
  > *Is still employed by anthropologists to understand present cultural phenomena in relation to the past.*

### **Conclusion**

> *Despite their valuable contributions to **anthropology**, especially **social and cultural anthropology**, the theories of classical evolutionists faced **severe criticism** in later periods.*
