# **CULTURE**

### 1. **Importance and Influence of the Concept**

* The anthropological concept of *culture* has been one of the most important and influential ideas in twentieth-century thought.  
* Originally adopted by nineteenth-century anthropologists, the term “culture” has since spread to other fields with profound impact.  
* **Paradox**: Despite its influence, the notion of culture has often been:
  * **Too broad and blunt** to effectively analyze human behavior.
  * Leading some scholars to **abandon** the term.
  * Encouraging others to **refine and sharpen** the definition for more precise use.
* Anthropologists themselves have not always used the term with total **precision or consistency**.

### 2. **Anthropological Usage of 'Culture'**

* In anthropology, *culture* does **not** mean cultivation in the arts or social graces.
* Instead, it refers to **learned, accumulated experience**.
* Example: *American culture* includes socially transmitted behavior patterns specific to the American social group.

### 3. **Key Definitions of Culture**

**Edward B. Tylor**
* Defined culture as:
  > “Culture is the complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and other capabilities acquired by man as a member of society.”

**Robert Redfield**
* Described culture as:
  > “An organized body of conventional understandings, manifest art and artifact, persists through tradition, characterises a society.”

### 4. **Core Characteristics of Culture**

1. **Acquired Nature**:
   * Culture is **learned** and passed down from one generation to another within a society.
   
2. **Specificity**:
   * As noted by **Kluckhohn**:
     > Culture is the “distinctive way of life of a group of people, their complete design for living.”

3. **Contrast with Animal Behavior**:
   * Human behavior is **learned**, unlike **instinctive** animal behavior.
   * Culture represents **socialization** and **learned behavior**.

4. **Artificial Environment**:
   * According to **Herskovits**:
     > Culture is “the artificial environment created by man around himself.”

5. **Components of Culture** (from McGee):
   * Any piece or pattern of behavior.
   * Attitudes, values, beliefs.
   * Skills learned by humans as group members.
   * Material items made or used through learned abilities.

### 5. **Material vs. Non-Material Culture**

* Debate among scholars:
  * **Some sociologists and anthropologists** ignore **material objects** as part of culture.
  * **Others consider** *material culture* an **important aspect**.

### 6. **Culture as Superorganic**

* Sociologists like **Kingsley Davis** describe culture as **superorganic**:
  * Culture is **independent** of organic (biological) and inorganic (physical) elements.
  * Social meaning determines whether something belongs in the realm of culture.

## **Characteristics of Culture**

### **Universal Characteristics Identified by Anthropologists**

Although anthropologists differ in their views about the universal characteristics of culture, some commonly accepted characteristics are discussed below:

### **1. Culture is an Acquired Quality**
* Culture is **not innate**.
* Includes all things **made or modified by man**.
* Traits are **learned through socialization**, including habits and thoughts.
* Man’s **capacity for symbolic communication** allows him to acquire cultural behaviour.

### **2. Culture is Found Only in Human Society**
* Though animals form societies, they do **not possess culture**.
* Culture is **exclusive to human societies**.
* Man is the **only cultured being**.

### **3. Culture is Social, Not Individualistic**
* While individuals contribute to the **expansion and communication** of culture,  
  culture is inherently **social**.
* Culture involves **common expectations** shared by group members.
* **Individuals cannot create culture** in isolation.

### **4. Culture is Idealistic**
* Culture reflects the **ideas and norms** of a group.
* It is the **sum-total of ideal patterns and behaviours** of a group.

### **5. Culture is the Total Social Heritage**
* Culture is deeply **linked to the past**.
* The past continues to live through **traditions and customs** passed across generations.
* Culture is a **means of historical continuity**.

### **6. Culture Fulfils Certain Needs**
* Culture satisfies **moral and social needs** that are practical.
* Includes **collective habits**, which form only when they **fulfil some need**.
* Elements of culture **not aiding social stratification** may eventually become extinct.

### **7. Culture is Integrated**
* Culture has an **order and system**.
* Its **various parts are interconnected** and integrated.

### **8. Culture is Communicable**
* Communicated through **language** from one generation to another.
* Ensures **regular expansion** of culture.
* Allows the new generation to **benefit from the experiences** of the old.
* Culture’s **permanence** is unaffected by the **mortality of individuals or groups**.

### **9. Culture is Capable of Adjustment**
* Culture can **change and adapt**.
* It evolves from **homogeneity to heterogeneity**, and from **simplicity to sophistication**.
* Adapts to **new and complex situations**.

### **10. Culture is a Symbolic, Continuous, Cumulative, and Progressing Process**
* Culture is:
  * **Symbolic**
  * **Acquired**
  * **Learnt**
  * **Idealistic**
  * **Fulfilling human needs**
  * **Communicative**
  * **Adjustable**
  * **Integrated**
* Its **social heritage** testifies to its **dignity**.

## **Scope of Cultural Applicability**

### **1. Universality of Culture**
* Classical anthropologists believed in the **Universality of Applicability of Culture**.
* They attempted to **standardize human culture**.
* Evaluated **primitive societies** through this standardized lens.
* This approach was **eventually discarded**.

### **2. Ethnocentrism**
* A subsequent group of anthropologists judged **alien cultures** by **their own cultural standards**.
* This method is termed **Ethnocentricism**.
* **Flaws of Ethnocentrism**:
  * Undermines the **logic and autonomy** of the observed culture.

### **3. Cultural Relativism**
* Some anthropologists proposed that cultures should be understood **through their own logic and meanings**.
* This approach is called the **relative method**, and the principle is known as **Cultural Relativism**.

---

## **Nature of Culture**

### **Foundational Definitions of Culture**

**1. Edward B. Tylor**
* Tylor's definition is considered a **milestone** in the **scientific study of culture**.

**2. Kluckhohn and Kelly**
* Provided a more elaborate view of culture as:
  > “All historically created designs for living, explicit and implicit, rational, irrational and non-rational, which may exist at any given time as potential guides for the behaviour of men.”

**3. Kroeber and Kluckhohn (1952)**
* Offered a comprehensive definition, stating:
  > “Patterns, explicit and implicit, of and for behaviour acquired and transmitted by symbols, constituting the distinctive achievements of human groups, including their embodiments in artifacts.”

### **Summary Insight**

* All the definitions listed above contribute important perspectives and collectively help to **shed light on the nature of culture**.

---

## **Culture as a System**

### **1. Culture as a 'Complex Whole'**

* **Tylor's Vision**: Culture is a *‘complex whole’* with parts well integrated with each other.  
* The **configuration of culture** refers to its distinctive form, derived from the relationship between its parts.  
* Culture maintains **internal integration**, aligned with the **belief and value system** underlying it.  
* The **integration of cultural traits** is more crucial than merely listing those traits.

### **2. Elements of a Cultural System**

* **Material Culture**:
  * Comprises **visible objects**.
  * Examples: Tools, clothing, buildings.
* **Non-Material Culture**:
  * Includes **norms, values, attitudes** toward material objects.
  * Sub-divided into:
    * **Normative culture**
    * **Cognitive culture**

### **3. Approaches to Understanding Cultural Systems**

* **Analytic Approach**:
  * Breaks down the ‘complex whole’ into its individual components (**traits**).
  * Each trait is studied **independently** of others.
* **Synthetic Approach**:
  * Studies **traits in relation** to other traits within the cultural framework.

### **4. Cognitive Culture**

* Relates to the **broad cultural ideology**.
* Provides a **framework** for:
  * Viewing
  * Designing
  * Understanding everything that exists
* **Beliefs vs. Knowledge**:
  * Sometimes **distinguished** from each other.
  * As **Johnson** states:
    > “Tested empirical knowledge and untestable beliefs are elements of culture in the sense that they are often mixed together in the same concrete acts; a process of intellectual analysis is necessary to separate the different elements from one another.”
* **Includes**:
  * All human actions
  * Forms the **basis for normative rules**

### **5. Normative Culture**

* Operates within the **framework** set by cognitive culture.
* Includes **norms or standards of behaviour**.
* **Norms and values** are **inseparable**.

### **Role of Norms**
* Provide **guidelines for behaviour** in various situations.
* Violation of norms leads to **sanctions**.

### **Sumner's Categorization (1906)**
* **Mores**:
  * Norms with **strong compulsion** to conform.
  * Violation results in **serious reactions or organized sanctions**.
  * Often enforced through **law** in modern societies.
* **Folkways:**
    * Norms representing **usual ways of doing things**.  
    * Breach does **not entail serious penalty**.
    * Seen as **conventional practices** with **existing alternatives**.
    * In modern society, **folkways change rapidly** and lack a formal enforcing agency.

---

## **Culture is Diverse**

### **1. Cultural Diversity and Uniqueness**

* While all human societies possess **culture**, each society has **distinct cultural elements**.
* These **peculiarities**, when seen through the concept of the *“complex whole,”* help **differentiate one culture from another**.
  
**Cultural Relativity**

* This diversity leads to the development of the concept of **cultural relativity** in sociological studies.
* **Bidney** explains:
  > Since all cultures differ from one another, it is not possible to have a universal judgement of values.
* **McGee** defines cultural relativity as:
  > “Sees each culture as a unique adjustment to a particular set of circumstances and suggests that to understand the appropriate structure and content of a particular culture, you must understand its particular circumstances.”
* In simpler terms:
  * Each culture owes its particular state to:
    * **Historical processes**
    * The **interpretation** of those processes by people within that culture

### **2. Ethnocentrism: The Opposite of Cultural Relativity**

**Definition and Impact**
* If **cultural relativity** is one side of the coin, **ethnocentrism** is the other.
* A major challenge in cultural studies is our **unawareness of our own cultural patterns**.
* **Cultural perception** is shaped like wearing **glasses with distorting lenses**:
  * What we assume to be real is actually filtered through this **perceptual screen**.
  * As a result, we often find other cultures **strange or wrong** at first encounter.
* This tendency is called **ethnocentrism**:
  > “Each group considers its way of life the natural and the best way. Strange groups, beliefs or practices are treated with suspicion and hostility simply because they are strange.”  
  — *Broom and Selznick*

**Characteristics of Ethnocentrism**
* **Intense identification with the familiar**
* **Devaluation of the foreign**
* Belief that one’s own culture is the **best in all respects**
* Other cultures viewed as **inferior**, **barbaric**, **heathen**, or **outlandish**
* **Consequences of Extreme Ethnocentrism**:
  * **Rejects** the richness and knowledge of other cultures
  * **Impairs** the sharing of ideas and skills
  * **Obstructs** progress toward societal goals
* Simplified definition:
  > “Judging other peoples, cultures, customs or values from the perspective of one’s own.”
* Ethnocentrism is rooted in:
  * Loyalty to one’s own culture
  * Strong or mild **rejection of others**

## **3. Ethnocentrism vs. Cultural Diffusion**

* **Ethnocentrism impedes**:
  * Cultural diffusion
  * Cooperation between cultures
* By contrast, **cultural relativity**:
  * Can **enhance understanding**
  * May lead to either **cooperation** or **conflict**
* Therefore, to **evaluate a social issue objectively**:
  * It must be understood in **its own cultural setting**
  * **Ethnocentric bias should be avoided**

---

## **Culture is Shared**

### **1. Culture as Social Heritage**

* Culture is often referred to as the **social heritage**.
* This heritage:
  * **Belongs to society as a whole**
  * Is **transmitted across generations** within social groups

### **2. Commonalities and Variations in Culture**

* When viewed **as a concept**, culture reveals:
  * **Commonalities across human society**
  * **Variations within different social groups**
* In a **narrow sense**, culture:
  * **Varies significantly** among different groups
  * Displays **heterogeneity** in content, form, and expression

### **3. Unity in Diversity**

* Despite visible differences, **the unity of mankind** lies in:
  * The **overwhelming similarities** across different cultures
  * Shared values, norms, and behaviours that connect human groups

### **4. Historical and Environmental Roots of Culture**

* Culture evolves through:
  * A group’s **historical experience**
  * Continuous **adaptation to its environment**
* Function of culture:
  * Acts as an **adaptive mechanism**
  * Enhances **efficiency** and **survival chances** of a social group

---

## Culture is Learnt

### 1. Culture as Superorganic
* As said earlier, culture is taken to be **superorganic**.  
* Yet **“whatever we observe and interpret is conditioned by the ways we have been made to do so.”**

### 2. Human Learning Capacity
* **“A human baby is born without any distinct advantage compared to the babies of other animals but he has immense capacity to learn.”**  
* All **voluntary actions are learnt** and thus are a **part of culture**.

### 3. Cultural Conditioning of Perception
* **“Observations and interpretations of various phenomena and things differ markedly in different cultures;”**  
* A human being, as a member of a particular social group, **“learns what his environment conditions him to do.”**

### 4. Scope of Cultural Knowledge
* Though culture is learned, every member of a culture **knows (learns and understands) elements directly concerned with him.**  
* **Others he takes for granted.**

---

## Culture is Based on Symbols

### 1. Human Use of Symbols
* Though **animals do use symbols for communication**, the human use of symbols is distinct.
* As **McGee** remarks:  
  > “Something representing or ‘standing for’ something else by arbitrary human invention and agreement. Symbolizing ability is the capacity freely and arbitrarily to bestow meaning on things.”

### 2. Learning Symbolic Meaning
* The **meaning of a symbol may be arbitrary**, but its **understanding is not instinctive**—it **must be learnt**.
* **Language** is probably the best example of the use of symbols and highlights the importance of **‘learning’**.

### 3. Cultural Gestures
* Gestures—specifically **culturally important gestures**—are also:
  * **Learnt**, not innate.
  * **Interpreted** according to one’s **own sense of belonging** to a culture.

### Symbol Use in Higher Primates

**1. Primate Symbol Learning**
* **Recently**, some higher primates (e.g., **Chimpanzees and Gorillas**) have been shown to:
  * Have the capacity to **learn symbols**.
  * **Rightly interpret an object**, but **only in its presence**.

**2. Leslie White's Perspective**
* **Leslie White** defines the ability to symbolize as:
  > “Freely and arbitrarily to originate, determine, and bestow meaning upon things and events in the external world, the ability to comprehend such meanings.”

* Based on this, White **does not consider** the ape’s capacity to understand symbols as representing the **capacity for culture**.

**3. Animal Communication Limitations**
* Animals **lack symbolic interpretation** of things and phenomena.
* Their expression is often through **sign language**, which is:
  * **Much more instinctive** than learned.

---

### Subcultures

**1. Definition and Nature**
* Most cultures are actually the **sum total of the culture of heterogeneous groups** combined.
* In this context, **culture is a compound of subcultures**, where:
  * A **subculture** refers to the culture of a **homogeneous unit** within the **heterogeneous whole**.

**2. Structure of Large Social Groups**
* Large social groups are typically composed of **smaller units**, each with:
  * Distinct **values**
  * **Norms**
  * **Attitudes**, etc.
* These attributes may differ **from other units** within the same larger group.

**3. Characteristics of Subcultures**
* As noted by **Broom and Selznick**:  
  > “Subcultures are distinguishable from one another and from the dominant culture forms by such manifest characteristics as language, clothing, gesture, and etiquette. There are also less public but equally important differences in norms and values.”

**4. Sources of Differentiation**
* Subcultures may vary due to:
  * **Ethnic**
  * **Occupational**
  * **Regional** heterogeneity
* Such variation is especially noticeable **across large areas**.

**5. Modern Context**
* **Differences between subcultures** are more pronounced in **modern industrial societies**.
* Here, **cultural content** is often influenced by **economic progress**.

**6. Cultural Unity Despite Differences**
* Despite micro-level differences, **subcultural units** within a culture show **enough similarities** to be classified as part of **one overarching culture**.

---

### Counterculture

* A **conceptual term** coined by **Yinger**.
* **Counterculture** applies when a **subculture’s ideas and behavior patterns conflict** with those of the **majority culture**.

---

### Cultural Trait, Complex, and Universals

**1. Cultural Trait**
* A **cultural trait** is:
  * **Any single item** related to one **definite activity** within a culture.

**2. Cultural Complex**
* The **sum total of cultural traits** involved in producing a single cultural object is called a **cultural complex**.

**3. Core Culture**
* **Core culture** consists of the **elements shared by most members** of a society.

**4. Cultural Universals**
* **Cultural traits** that are **followed by all members** of a society are known as **cultural universals**.

---

## SOCIAL AND CULTURAL CHANGE

### 1. Diffusion and Acculturation

**Cultural Diffusion**
* Occurs when **two societies come into close contact** and begin **sharing cultural traits and cultural complexes**.
* This process has **accelerated in recent times** due to increased communication between different social groups.

**Acculturation**
* Happens when a **culture comes into contact with a dominant culture**.
* The **weaker culture borrows cultural elements and traits** from the dominant one **without sharing its own**.
* This **one-way borrowing** by a person or social group is known as **acculturation**.

**Cultural Conflict**
* **Not all cultural contact leads to diffusion or acculturation**.
* Sometimes, **mutual misunderstanding** of values, attitudes, etc., leads to **culture conflict**.
* Important note:
  > "It is the people who are in conflict and not the cultures."

### 2. Cultural Lag

* **Technological changes bring about cultural changes**.
* These changes affect **different segments of a culture unevenly**—some parts **respond faster** than others.
* After each technological shift, **culture attempts to adjust** to meet new human needs.
* In modern industrial society, **rapid technological change outpaces cultural adaptation**, leading to **maladjustments**.
* The **delay in cultural adjustment** is termed **cultural lag**.

### 3. Marxism and Social Changes

* According to **Marx**:
  * Early humans lived in **primitive communism**, where the **means of production were shared** by the group.
  * Technological changes led to **monopoly of production** by a few individuals.
  * These individuals became **dominant** and shaped cultural change **to suit their needs**.
  * The **majority followed**, having little control over the direction of change.
* With each **technological shift**, there was a **change in power structure**:
  * The **dominant group is not static** but changes over time.
* Marx's core idea:
  > “The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggle. This struggle shall continue till all distinctions based on class vanish completely.”
* Marx explains **social change through contradictions** in the **infrastructure of society**.

### 4. Weber and Social Change

* **Weber** recognized a **direct relationship between ethics and economic systems**, but **unlike Marx**, he did **not believe** the economic system **determines societal ethics**.
* In *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism*, Weber:
  * Explored the **influence of ethical and religious beliefs** on **economic values**.
  * Focused on **belief systems** and how they **impact group growth and economic development**.

### 5. Functional Approach to Social Change

According to the **functional approach**, **social change occurs** when:

1. **Human needs change**.
2. **Existing institutions fail** to meet these new needs.
3. **Better alternatives** emerge to fulfill these needs.

## Relation Between Culture and Civilization


### 1. Anthropological Views on Civilization

Anthropologists offer **diverse conceptualizations** of *civilization*, each focusing on different criteria:

* **Ogburn and Nimkoff**:  
  * View **civilization as the later phase** of the **superorganic culture**.
* Some scholars:
  * Base the idea of civilization on **civil organization** (as opposed to **clan or kinship** organization).
  * Note that **civil organization** is more common in **large towns**, hence, inhabitants of such towns are referred to as **civilized**.
* **Goldenweiser**:
  * **Equates** the term **civilization with culture**.
* Other theorists:
  * Use the term **civilization** for **selected parts** of a culture rather than the whole.
* **Arnold Toynbee**:
  * Describes civilization as:
    > “Essentially a religious and ethical system holding sway over an area often larger than a state or nation.”
  * Such a system is **unified by customs, institutions, and ideologies**.
* **Gillin and Gillin**:
  * Argue that **civilization is far more complex than culture**.
* **MacIver**:
  * Takes a **utilitarian and instrumental view**.
  * Defines civilization as:
    > “Utilitarian things — the whole mechanism and social organism, techniques and material instruments — which have been devised by man in his endeavour to control the conditions of his life.”
  * These aspects function as **means to ends**.
* **A.W. Green**:
  * Provides an **exhaustive definition**:
    > “A culture becomes civilization only when it possesses written language, science, philosophy, a specialized division of labour, and a complex technology and political system.”

### 2. Universally Accepted Characteristics of Civilization

These characteristics are commonly agreed upon by scholars as indicators of *civilization*:

1. **Agricultural surplus** enables the **concentration of population** in specific areas.
2. These **population concentrations** evolve into centers for:
   * **Trade**
   * **Commerce**
   * **Government**
   * **Education**
   * **Religion**
3. Institutions such as the **military** and **economy** are managed by a **class of specialists** with adequate managerial skills.
4. **Functional specialization** and **division of labour** increase.
5. A **ruling class** emerges that **controls the means of production**.
6. **Wealth and power concentrate** in fewer hands, leading to:
   * A transformation from **egalitarian society** to one based on **inequality and social stratification**.
7. Civilization is characterized by a **centralized and hierarchical political system**.
8. A **gradual separation** occurs between the **religious** and **secular** spheres.

---

## Culture vs Civilization

Following McIver, the **key differences** between *culture* and *civilization* are outlined as follows:

### 1. Standard of Measurement

* **Civilization**:
  * Has a **precise standard of measurement**.
  * Is **quantitatively measurable** based on efficiency.
  * Products can be compared and judged superior or inferior (e.g., lorry vs. bullock cart, powerloom vs. handloom, tractor vs. hand plough, currency vs. barter system).
* **Culture**:
  * **Cannot be measured** with any standardized scale.
  * Judgments vary by time, group, and personal taste.
  * Examples:
    * Some view Picasso’s paintings as abominations; others see them as masterpieces.
    * Preferences differ between Bernard Shaw and Shakespeare.
    * Folk songs vs. film songs.

### 2. Progress and Development

* **Civilization**:
  * Is **always advancing**.
  * According to MacIver:
    > "Civilization not only marches, it marches always… unilinear and cumulative… tends to advance indefinitely."
  * Examples: Continuous improvements in automobiles, railways, ships, airplanes.
* **Culture**:
  * Advances **slowly** and is subject to **retrogression**.
  * No guarantee of progress to higher standards.
  * Example: Modern art and literature may not surpass Ajanta paintings or ancient poetry.

### 3. Transmission

* **Civilization**:
  * Is **transmitted effortlessly**.
  * Its products can be enjoyed without sharing the creator’s skill or intent.
* **Culture**:
  * Requires **effort and compatibility**.
  * Can only be **assimilated by the likeminded** and those **worthy of it**.

### 4. Possibility of Improvement

* **Civilization**:
  * Can be **improved by anyone**, even lesser minds.
  * Example: Technological innovations can be enhanced by successors.
* **Culture**:
  * Can **only be perfected by its original creators** or similarly gifted individuals.
  * Lesser artists may **spoil** rather than improve cultural works.
  * Culture is a **direct expression of human spirit** and personality.

### 5. Nature: External vs Internal

* **Civilization**:
  * Is **external** and **mechanical**.
  * Includes tools, technologies, institutions.
* **Culture**:
  * Is **internal** and **organic**.
  * Encompasses thoughts, feelings, values, ideals.
  * MacIver states:
    > “Civilization is what we have; culture is what we are.”

### 6. Borrowing and Adaptation

* **Civilization**:
  * Can be **borrowed easily**, without change or loss.
  * Spreads rapidly with communication advancements.
* **Culture**:
  * Has an **intrinsic quality** and limited appeal.
  * Cannot be borrowed in full; only select aspects are adopted.
  * Borrowed cultural elements are often **modified** by the borrower's personality.
  * Example: India has adopted much of Western civilization but only fragments of Western culture.

## Interdependence and Interaction

Despite their differences, **culture and civilization are interdependent and interactive**:

* **Artifacts** (products of civilization) are influenced by **mentifacts** (products of culture).
* Civilization is shaped by cultural preferences:
  * People desire not just functionality but **beauty and aesthetic appeal**.
  * Example: The design of an automobile or radio is influenced by cultural taste.
* **Culture is also influenced by civilization**:
  * Example: The **printing press** has shaped philosophies, literature, and education.

## Cultural Aspects of Civilization

* Over time, **objects of civilization acquire cultural meaning**:
  * Primitive tools become **symbols of culture**.
  * Excavated items like pots, clothing, tools, coins reveal past cultures.
  * Legal documents (constitutions, codes) are not merely administrative; they **embody the spirit** of a people and are **treasured as cultural expressions**.
> In summary, although *civilization* and *culture* have distinct characteristics, they continuously **influence, reflect, and reinforce** one another.

# **SOCIETY**

### **1. Understanding Society in Sociology**

* In everyday terms, *society* is often seen as a simple group of people.
* However, in **sociological parlance**, society is a much more complex and structured concept.
* Despite its foundational role in sociological studies, there is no universally accepted definition of society among sociologists.

### **2. Functional Definitions of Society**

**MacIver's View**
* Society is:
  * “A system of usages and procedures, of authority and mutual aid, of many groupings and divisions, of controls of human behaviour and liberties.”
  * “This ever changing system we call society. It is web of social relationship. And it is always changing.”
* Emphasis: Functional aspects and constant change.

**Cooley's Perspective**
* Society is:
  * “A complex of forms or processes each of which is living and growing by interaction with the others, the whole being so unified that what takes place in one part affects all the rest.”
* Emphasis: Interaction and interdependence.

**Parsons' Definition**
* Society is:
  * “The total complex of human relationships in so far as they grow out of action in terms of mean-end relationship, intrinsic or symbolic.”
* Emphasis: Human relationships and goal-oriented actions.

### **3. Structural Definitions of Society**

**Giddings' View**
* Society is:
  * “The union itself, the organization, the sum of formal relations in which associating individuals are bound together.”
* Emphasis: Formal structures and organizational relations.

**Ginsberg's Definition**
* Society is:
  * “A collection of individuals united by certain relations or modes of behaviour which mark them off from others who do not enter into these relations or who differ from them in behaviour.”
* Emphasis: Shared behaviors and social boundaries.

### **4. Integrative Perspectives**

* There is **no fundamental conflict** between structural and functional definitions.
* These approaches are **complementary**, highlighting different facets of the same phenomenon.

### **5. McGee’s Comprehensive Definition**

**Key Components**
According to McGee, a viable definition of society must include:
1. **Social organization** regulating interaction between group members.
2. **Size of the group**, not in numbers but in terms of:
   * Organizational inclusiveness.
   * Distinctiveness.

**Definition**
* “The largest distinguishable unit of interacting individuals who share a pattern of social organization that regulates interaction between them.”
* A society:
  * Is the most **inclusive type of social organisation**.
  * **Dominates** all other organizations it incorporates.
  * Possesses **functional and cultural economy**.
  * Has an **independent existence**.

### **6. Essential Features of Society**

**Likeness**
* Society requires members to share common qualities.
* As MacIver notes:
  * “Comradeship, intimacy, association of any kind or degree would be impossible without some understanding of each by the other, that understanding depends on the likeness which each apprehends in the other.”

**Unlikeness**
* Differences are equally essential.
* Total similarity would eliminate the need for interaction.
* Diversity in **social, economic, political, ritual** spheres leads to:
  * Division of labour.
  * Greater cooperation.

**Interdependence**
* A society is:
  * An **independent group**.
  * Whose members are **mutually dependent** for survival.

---

## **SOCIETY: A WEB OF SOCIAL RELATIONS**

### **1. The Central Idea**

* The well-known dictum by **MacIver** holds true:
  * *All actions of individuals in a society are strongly influenced by their relationships.*
  * This influence is **mutual** among all members of the society.
* Therefore, **mutual recognition** of each other's **status and actions** is a key feature of society.

### **2. Sense of Belonging**

* **Giddings** emphasizes:
  * A “**sense of belonging together**” or a “**consciousness of the kind**” is essential in society.
* **Cooley** echoes this with the concept of the “**we**” feeling.

### **3. Social Cohesion Amid Conflict**

* While **wranglings** or disagreements may exist within a society:
  * Members consistently share a **feeling of familiarity** with one another.
  * This **shared sense of community** contributes to the social fabric.

---

## **SOCIETY – STRUCTURE**

### **1. Norms, Status, and Role**

* A **norm** refers to a rule governing the “do’s and don’ts” in society.
* However, not all norms apply equally to all members:
  * **Application and adherence** to norms is determined by **status**, defined as a *social position in relation to other such positions*.
* The set of norms assigned to a particular status is called a **role**.

**Key Points**
* **Status and Role**:
  * Form the **foundation of all social interaction**.
  * Are **static** at a specific point in time, representing the **structure** of society.
* **Change Over Time**:
  * Both status and role can evolve in meaning and significance.
  * Thus, society is not truly static but exists in a **state of social equilibrium** at any given moment.

### **2. Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft (Tönnies, 1887)**

**Gemeinschaft (Communal Society)**
* Defined as a society one feels **belonging to** due to **similarities with other members**.
* Characteristics:
  * Individuals are **born into** this type of society.
  * Each member has **definite functions** that naturally arise from membership.
  * Strong **kinship bonds** are central.
* **Decline in Gemeinschaft**:
  * Indicates a decline in the **sense of kinship**.

**Gesellschaft (Associational Society)**
* Defined as a society where social bonds are **voluntary** and based on **rational self-interest**.
* Characteristics:
  * Typical relationships are formed by **contract**, not kinship.
  * Traditional bonds weaken, and individuals are **loosely connected**.
  * Leads to a **mass society** with:
    * **Mass participation**
    * **Majority decision-making** on important societal matters.

### **3. Historical and Cultural Trends**

* According to Tönnies:
  > “*Gemeinschaft* is old; *Gesellschaft* is new as a name as well as a phenomenon. Whenever urban culture blossoms and bears fruits, *Gesellschaft* appears as its indispensable organ. The rural people know little of it.”

* Historical patterns suggest a general **transition from Gemeinschaft to Gesellschaft**.

### **Counter Trends**
* However, this transition is **not always the rule**.
* Modern developments such as:
  * The **quest for community life**
  * **Increased centralization** (especially in totalitarian societies)
* Indicate potential **reversals** or **alternative movements** in societal organization.

## **ORIGIN OF SOCIETY**

The **origin of society** has been a significant subject of inquiry for philosophers and thinkers throughout history. Various theories have been proposed to explain how society came into being. Below are some of the major theories:

### **1. Theory of Divine Origin**

* This theory suggests that society was created by divine will.
* **Note**: 
  * It holds *no scientific or sociological value*.
  * Its significance is *purely historical*.

### **2. Familial Theories**

* Supported by **Henry Maine** and others.
* Main idea:
  * The **origin of the family** led to the **formation of society**.
* However:
  * Some **anthropologists** argue that **society existed even before the family**.

### **3. Theory of Social Contract**

* Proponents: **Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau**.
* Basic premise:
  * Society, like the state, is a **result of a social contract**.
* Key differences:
  * These thinkers vary in their views on:
    * The **nature of the pre-social state**.
    * The **purpose** of the contract.
* Common ground:
  * Some **problem or condition** compelled individuals to form a contract, leading to the **creation of society**.

### **4. Group Mind Theory**

* Main supporters: **Plato, Hegel, Bosanquet, and McDougall**.
* Core belief:
  * The **individual without society is merely an abstraction**.
* **McDougall’s View**:
  > "The society has a mental life which is not the mere sum of mental lives of the units. If and in so far as they could be known as isolated units, it would not enable us to deduce the nature of the life of the whole in the way that is implied in Spencer’s analogies."
* This theory:
  * **Rejects** the **organic theory** of society.
  * Faces criticism:
    * The concept of a **"group mind"** is questioned as it may not be a **realistic entity**.

### **5. Organic Theory of Society**

* Proposed by **Herbert Spencer**.
* Main idea:
  * Society is **like a living organism**.
  * In both individual and social organisms:
    * The **parts are interdependent** and **cannot be separated**.
* Criticism:
  * Though influential, it is now largely seen as having **historical value only**.

### **6. Modern View**

* Views society as a product of **evolution**.
* Contributions to the formation of early society:
  * The **family** played a central role.
  * Desire to:
    * **Protect family members**
    * Organize **religious practices**
    * Develop **food acquisition systems**
  * These needs led to the **elementary forms of social organization**.

## **TYPES OF SOCIETY**

### **Overview**

* All **human societies**, both past and present, can be categorized into **basic types**.
* These classifications are based on:
  * **Technological level**
  * The **role of the environment** in shaping the culture of the society

### **Main Classification**

The most common categorization differentiates societies into:

1. **Tribal Societies**
2. **Agrarian Societies**
3. **Industrial Societies**

### **Key Points**

* Although the **main distinction** between these types is **economic**, it’s important to note:
  * **Economy** is one institution that strongly influences **other social institutions**.
  * This influence is **mutual**—other institutions can also shape the economy.

### **Characteristic Features**

Each of the three types of society has its **own characteristic features**, which are discussed **briefly** below and elaborated further in topics dealing with **various institutions**.

---

## **Tribal Society**

### **1. General Characteristics**

---

## **Agrarian Society**

### **1. Definition and Primary Occupation**

* Unlike tribal societies, individuals in agrarian societies are **not expected to be fully self-sufficient**.

### **2. Economic Structure**

* Agrarian society includes **heterogeneous occupational groups**, such as:
  * **Farmers**
  * Various **artisan groups**
* **Economic contrasts with tribal society**:
  * Tribal societies emphasize self-sufficiency.
  * Agrarian societies feature **specialized roles** and economic **diversification**.

**Land Ownership Patterns**

  * **Sharecropping arrangements**
* **Economic disparities** are prominent:
  * **Large landowners** on one end
  * **Landless laborers** on the other

### **3. Livelihood and Resources**

  * **Domesticated animals** playing multiple roles
  * **Abundant and predictable food supplies**

### **4. Settlement and Lifestyle**

* Life is generally:
  * **Village-based**
  * **Sedentary**, as opposed to the mobility seen in earlier forms of society

### **5. Social Mobility and Control**

* **Social mobility** is:
  * **Limited** or **rare**
* **Social control** is maintained through:
  * **Informal means**, rather than formal legal institutions

### **6. Transitional Nature**

  * **More advanced economically** than tribal society
  * It still **resembles tribal society** in many aspects of **social and political life**

---

## **Industrial Society**

### **1. Introduction and Historical Background**

* **Tribal societies** have received ample discussion in earlier sections; **industrial society** requires deeper focus here.
* According to **Bell**, the industrial society:
  > “is organized around the axis of production and machinery for fabrication of goods. In its rhythm of life and organization of work, industrial society is the defining feature of social structure i.e. the economy, the occupational system, and the stratification system—of modern western Society.”
* The **Industrial Revolution**:
  * Began in **Britain** at the end of the **18th century**
  * Emerged roughly **5,000 years after the use of the plough**
  * Initially affected **handloom cottage industries**
  * Over time, industrialization **deeply influenced the societies it touched**, transforming traditional value systems into **modern ones**

### **2. Key Characteristics of Industrial Society**

**a. Formal Education**

* A **typical characteristic** of industrial societies
* In contrast to agrarian societies, where education is limited to a **privileged few**
* Designed to meet the **labour force requirements** of a specialized and technical economy
* Supports a **strong division of labour** through specialized training

**b. Urbanization and Economic Systems**

* Industrialization leads to:
  * **Urbanization**
  * Establishment of a **modern wage system**
  * Growth of institutions like the **stock exchange**
  * Rise of **labour unions** and **trade unions**
* Results in a **higher standard of living**
* Economic transformation **impacts all other social institutions**

### **3. Social Transformation and Changing Values**

**a. Family and Kinship**

* **Traditional values decline** in favour of **modern values**
* Significant changes in family structure:
  * **Nuclear families** replace extended kinship networks
  * **Kinship bonds weaken**, with less emphasis on relations beyond immediate family
  * **Functions of the family** (economic, educational, protective) are increasingly handled by:
    * **Government**
    * **Private agencies**

**b. Religion**

* No longer a **family affair**
* Becomes a **personal** and **individual** concern

### **4. Aspirations and Social Roles**

* **Economic achievements** foster **greater aspirations** for upward mobility
* Transformation occurs in:
  * **Social roles**
  * **Economic roles**
  * **Political roles**
* Roles and their **connotations evolve**, reflecting the dynamics of industrial life

---

## Post-Industrial Society

The concept of the **post-industrial society** refers to rapid transformations in the industrial landscape, particularly in the United States. This futuristic concept was introduced by **D. Bell**, who outlined key characteristics and guiding principles of this emerging societal structure.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Theoretical Knowledge as a Driving Force**
* According to D. Bell, post-industrial society operates on a **special principle of codification of theoretical knowledge**.
* This codified knowledge:
  * **Directs innovations in science**
  * **Anticipates future trends**
  * **Supports forecasting and planning**

2. **Growth of Services**
* A significant shift from industrial production to **personal and business services**.
* These services become **frequent and essential** in daily and economic life.

3. **Rise of the New Intelligentsia**
* Services related to:
  * **Health**
  * **Research**
  * **Education**
  * **Government**
* These sectors constitute the **new intelligentsia**, marking a rise in the importance of intellectual and service-based labor.

4. **Value of Professional and Technical Services**
* Increased respect and value for:
  * **Professional services**
  * **Technical services**
* These services are crucial for managing complex systems and ensuring societal efficiency.

5. **Focus on Technological Research**
* **Technological research** is strategically directed:
  * With a **view toward future trends**
  * Serving as a tool for innovation and advancement

# Status and Role

# Understanding **Status**

Sociologists use the term **status** in two interrelated ways:

1. **Social Position**  
   * Refers to a person's position in society without implying any hierarchy.
2. **Social Ranking**  
   * Refers to one's ranking within a social system, with implications of higher or lower standing.

### Status Differentiation in Society

* Every society has a system of **status differentiation** where an individual's position is defined by a social group.
* **Max Weber** defined status as:  
  > *“The honour accorded (to a person or group) by the community.”*
* This honour may be based on factors such as:
  * Family background  
  * Ethnicity  
  * Education  
  * Property  
  * Caste  

### Types of Status

### 1. **Ascribed Status**
* **Definition:** Status assigned at birth, without individual effort.
* **Based on:**  
  * Birth in a group  
  * Sex  
  * Age  
  * Biological relationships  
* **Examples of Ascribed Status Systems:**  
  * Ancient India  
  * Ancient Rome  
  * China  
  * Medieval Europe  
* **Characteristics:**
  * Limited social mobility  
  * Common in **caste societies**, which are stratified by birth  
  * Individuals are assigned a status group (e.g., sub-caste) where all members are considered equal
> A **status group** is a social group granted a certain level or status on the basis of ascription.
### 2. **Achieved Status**
* **Definition:** Status attained through personal accomplishments and effort.
* **Found in:** Open class societies  
* **Characteristics:**
  * Social mobility is encouraged and possible  
  * Personal achievements determine social position  
  * Members of different strata can mix freely  
  * Individuals can ascend the status ladder based on recognition by their social group

### Societal Implications of Status Systems

* **Ascribed Status Societies**:
  * Risk becoming rigid and inflexible  
  * May face **social ossification and disaster** due to lack of mobility  
  * Observation by Davis:  
    > *"Societies with absolute prescription of status, rigidity and least mobility, the society may get ossified and face disaster."*
* **Achieved Status Societies**:
  * May lead to **intense specialization**  
  * Risk of **uncontrolled individualism**  
  * Potential **loss of social cohesion**  
  * Davis remarks:  
    > *“Intense specialization leading to a failure of society’s members to understand each other... uncontrolled individualism with consequent loss of social cohesion.”*
* **Note:** No society exists in the **absolute form** as either a caste or an open class society.

### Status and Social Interaction

* In **social interaction**, the focus is not on the **individuals themselves**, but on their **social status**.
* Thus, all social interaction is, in essence, **status interaction**, not personal interaction.

---

## Role

### Understanding the Concept of Role

* **Role** refers to the **pattern of behavior associated with a specific social status**.
* Social positions (statuses) are always in interaction, and their interaction is understood through roles.

### Definitions and Theoretical Explanation

* According to **Olsen**, a **role** (or social role) is:
  > “An interrelated set of expectations and actions that is associated with a position in a social organization.”
  
* Roles are:
  * **Patterns of action and interaction**
  * Enacted in **collective activity** or even when alone, guided by such activity
  * The **intersection** between individual action and participation in an organized or organizational setting

### Key Characteristics of Roles

1. **Roles Require Social Organization**
   * A role cannot exist in isolation.
   * It must be part of a broader social structure or organization.
2. **Roles Are Complementary or Reciprocal**
   * The meaning of a role is found in its interaction with another.
   * Example: A **university teacher** expresses their role in the presence of **students**.
   * Roles help define **responsibilities** in collective activities.
3. **Multiplicity of Roles**
   * An individual often performs multiple roles simultaneously.
   * Example: A university teacher may also be:
     * A husband
     * A father
     * A friend  
   * The complete set of roles performed by an individual is called a **role repertoire**.

### Role Partners and Role Sets

* **Role Partners**: People who enact the same kind of role.
  * Examples: Friends, students, workers
  * A role partner can perform their role **even without others** (e.g., a student can study alone).
* **Role Set**: 
  * A group of roles in interaction that are **complementary** to each other.
  * Examples:
    * Teacher–student
    * Superior–subordinate
  * A role set always involves **two or more interacting roles**.

### Ascribed and Achieved Roles

* Just like statuses, roles can also be:
  * **Ascribed Roles** – based on birth or uncontrollable attributes.
  * **Achieved Roles** – based on personal effort and accomplishments.
> In this context, the terms **'status'** and **'role'** may sometimes be used **interchangeably**.

---

## Role Expectations, Role Conflict, and Reinforcement of Roles

### Role Expectations

* As previously discussed, individuals perform a **role repertoire**—a collection of roles tied to their statuses.
* The performance of a role is shaped primarily by the **process of socialization**.

**Understanding Role Expectations**
* A person enacting a role must fully understand what is **expected** of them.
* **Role expectation** refers to an individual’s perception of how a specific role should be performed—by themselves or others.

**Types of Role Expectations**
According to **S. Sargent** (psychologist), there are three types:

1. **Normative Role Expectations**  
   * Based on societal norms and standards.
2. **Situational Role Expectations**  
   * Determined by specific circumstances or contexts.
3. **Personal Role Expectations**  
   * Influenced by an individual's own values, style, or personality.

> Note: *No role is so rigid that it completely prevents creativity in its performance.*

* However, some roles are more **clearly defined** and may demand a **specific style of enactment**.

### Role Conflict and Role Strain

**Role Conflict (Role Strain)**
* Occurs when an individual experiences **conflicting pressures** from multiple roles or within a single role.
* Example:  
  A role may demand **friendship or kinship**, but also require **impartial judgment**—creating internal tension.

**Types of Role Strain**
1. **Interrole Strain**  
   * Conflict **between two different roles** held by the same person.  
   * *Example:* A person must be a friend and a fair judge at the same time.
2. **Intrarole Strain**  
   * Inconsistency **within a single role**, where the individual **fails to meet expected behaviors**.  
   * *Example:* A teacher who cannot maintain discipline despite being expected to do so.

**Social Implications**
* If role strain occurs in individuals **occupying responsible positions**, it may lead to **serious consequences for society**.
* Therefore, **preventive measures** or **alternatives** are often employed to reduce the chances of conflict.

> *Example:* Senior military officials are generally **restricted from close social relationships** to prevent potential role conflict.

### Role Reinforcement

* The **opposite of role conflict**.
* Occurs when an individual performing **two roles simultaneously** is able to **fulfill the expectations of both** successfully.
* This leads to **reinforcement** and harmony between roles rather than conflict.

# Group: Primary, Secondary & Reference Groups

### Historical Context

* **Early Sociological Focus (Till the end of 19th century):**
  * Main interest was in the **evolution of society and culture**.
  * The **concept of 'group'** was not fully appreciated.
* **Later Realizations:**
  * **Small groups** are crucial in the study of society because:
    * They play a central role in **socialization**, whereas the society at large plays a minimal role.
    * **Social change** typically originates at the group level before affecting society more broadly.
  * Studying small groups in totality and drawing generalizations can greatly enhance the understanding of society.

### Definitions of Group

Despite decades of study, there is **no universally accepted definition** of a group. Below are notable definitions by various sociologists:

* **Bennet & Tumin:**  
  > "A number of people in definable and persisting interaction directed towards common goals and using agreed upon means."
* **Bogardus:**  
  > "A number of persons, two or more, who have some common objects of attention, who are stimulating to each other who have common loyalty and participate in similar activities."
* **Ehredge & Merrill:**  
  > "Two or more persons who are in communication over an appreciable period of time and who act in accordance with a common function or purpose."
* **Green:**  
  > "An aggregate of individual, which persists in time which has one or more interests and activities common, and which is organized."
* **Horton & Hunt:**  
  > "Aggregate of categorize of people who have consciousness of membership and of interaction."
* **McIver:**  
  > "Any collection of human beings who are brought into social relationships with one another."
* **Oemsted:**  
  > "A plurality of individuals, who are in contact with each other, who take one another into account and who are aware of some significant commonality."

### Simplified Understanding

* A **human group** can be defined as:
  > "A relatively small organization members of which identify and interact with each other in a personal manner."
* Societies consist of **hundreds of groups**, varying in **nature and function**.

### Classifications of Groups by Sociologists

Different sociologists have proposed different **group classifications** using various criteria:

1. **Cooley:**  
   * *Primary and Secondary Groups*
2. **Sumner:**  
   * *Ingroups and Outgroups*
3. **Tönnies:**  
   * *Communities and Associations*
4. **Ellwood:**  
   * *Involuntary and Voluntary*  
   * *Institutional and Non-institutional*  
   * *Temporary and Permanent*
5. **Leopold:**  
   * *Crowds, Groups and Abstract Collectivities*
6. **Miller:**  
   * *Horizontal and Vertical*
7. **Park and Burgess:**  
   * *Territorial and Non-territorial*
8. **Simmel:**  
   * *Dyad, Triad, Tetrad, etc.*

---

## **Primary Group**

### Understanding Primary Relations

Before understanding **primary groups**, it is important to understand **primary relations**, as described by **Broom & Selznick**:

1. **Response to Whole Persons**  
   * Interactions involve the whole personality, not just segments.
   * Responses are **unique and non-transferable**.
   * Wholeness means responding to many aspects of someone’s character and background.
   * Responses are **free and spontaneous**, allowing full emotional expression.
   * Example: A **bank officer-customer** relationship is not primary—it is limited and transferable.
2. **Personal Satisfaction is Paramount**  
   * One enters into primary relations because they contribute directly to **personal security and well-being**.
   * Primary relations are an **end in themselves**, not just a means to an end.

### Definition of Primary Group

* The term **“primary group”** was introduced by **Cooley**, who defined it as:
  > "By primary groups I mean those characterised by intimate face-to-face association and co-operation. They are primary, in several senses, but chiefly in that they are fundamental in framing the social nature and ideals of the individual..."
* **Key elements of Cooley’s definition:**
  * **Intimate association and cooperation**
  * **Fusion of individualities** into a shared identity or common whole
  * Emergence of a **"we" feeling**—a shared sense of belonging
  * One’s individual self becomes part of the group’s collective life and purpose

### Clarifying "Face-to-Face" Association

* The phrase **"face-to-face association"** should not be taken literally:
  * It refers to **social intimacy**, not **physical proximity**.
  * A courtroom, though physically close, lacks emotional intimacy and thus does **not** qualify as a primary group.
  * Contrarily, **family members** living apart can still form a primary group if emotional bonds persist.

### Primary Groups and the Individual

**Cooley** described primary groups as the **"nurseries of human nature"** for the following reasons:

* **Socialization Agent:**  
  * Most socialization occurs within **small, emotionally intimate groups**.
  * Primary groups form a bridge between the **individual** and **society**.
* **Social Order and Emotional Support:**  
  * The need for primary group membership helps maintain **social order**.
  * Emotional activities and support depend on **primary group bonds**.
  * For **physically handicapped** or **aged individuals**, life can be unbearable without primary relations.
* **Self-Confidence and Identity:**  
  * Recognition, acceptance, and belonging in a primary group foster **self-confidence**.
  * Identity and recognition in larger groups are rooted in **primary group relationships**.
* **Flexibility and Protection:**  
  > “The primary group protects the individual by reinterpreting and modifying rules and goals, and by adapting them to the capacities of the individual and to his special personal circumstances.”

### Primary Groups within Formal Organizations

Though **formal organizations** and **primary groups** may seem contradictory:

* Formal organizations:
  * Involve **impersonal, functional roles**.
  * Use individuals as **tools to achieve impersonal goals**.
* Yet, studies show:
  * Individuals in formal settings (e.g., factories, clubs) still seek **personal connection**.
  * **Primary groups within formal organizations** make work more **meaningful and productive**.
* Benefit to organizations:
  > “Where members are attached to a large organization through a primary group the capacity of the organization to mobilize and control them is increased.”
* Result:  
  * Primary group dynamics help integrate individuals into **larger social structures**.

### Primary Groups: Essential for Society

* Primary groups are the **soul of a society**.
* Many modern issues, especially in **industrial societies**, are attributed to the **loosening of primary group bonds**.
* **Personality development** in infancy and childhood relies on **social-psychological support** that only primary group structures can provide.

---

## **Secondary Group**

### 1. Nature and Characteristics

Secondary groups represent the **contrast** to primary groups in several key ways:

* **Unemotional and Impersonal Relations**:  
  * As a social group becomes larger, interpersonal relations lose emotional depth and become **impersonal** and **formal**.
* **Voluntary Membership Governed by Norms**:  
  * Membership is not automatic but **voluntary**, often controlled by:
    * Prescribed qualifications (e.g., **factory jobs**)
    * Social or economic status (e.g., **clubs**)
    * Professional criteria
* **Freedom of Membership**:  
  * Members can **join or leave** at will.
  * The association is **optional**, not bound by emotional ties.

### 2. Nature of Interaction

* **Formality in Interaction**:  
  * Members interact in a **formal** and **regulated** manner.
  * **No deep emotional bonds** are expected or formed.
* **Self-Interest as the Basis**:  
  * Intimacy and cooperation are generally motivated by **individual benefit** or **personal gain**.
* **Transitory Relations**:  
  * Membership and roles are **temporary**.
  * Individuals may leave to seek groups that offer **better personal or professional opportunities**.

### 3. Size and Scope

* **Variable and Often Large Size**:  
  * Secondary groups may include **millions of members**.
  * Members can be **geographically dispersed**, often **beyond national boundaries**.
* **Examples**:
  * **Red Cross Society**
  * **Rotary International**  
  *(These groups operate globally with vast memberships.)*

### 4. Role in Modern Society

* **Importance in Complex Societies**:  
  * In today’s **complex and modern social life**, many functions require **formal, large-scale organizations**.
  * These organizations typically operate within **bureaucratic structures**.
* **Examples of Functional Secondary Groups**:
  * **Banks**: Formal interaction between customers and counter clerks
  * **Railway Reservation Counters**: No personal knowledge of clients needed—only formal identification

* **Shift from Primary to Secondary Functions**:
  * Many functions once fulfilled by **primary groups** are now being performed by **secondary groups**.

---

## **Reference Group**

### 1. Concept and Origins

* The concept of the **reference group** was originally introduced by **Hayman** and later elaborated by **Merton**, **Turner**, and **Sheriff**.
* A **reference group** is a **real or imaginary group** that an individual uses as a **standard for self-assessment** or to evaluate his or her own situation.
* Often, people conform to the norms **not of the group they belong to**, but of a group they **aspire to be part of**.

### 2. Examples of Reference Group Behavior

* **Urban middle class** individuals frequently identify with **economically higher classes**, making the **upper class** their reference group.
* In **traditional India**, **lower castes** imitated **higher caste norms and values**:
  * This process is referred to as **Sanskritization**.
  * Here, **upper castes** served as **reference groups** for the lower castes.

### 3. Conditions for Reference Group Identification  
(*According to Johnson*)

Another group becomes a reference group for members of a group under the following circumstances:

1. **Aspirational Membership**  
   * Members of one group aspire to **join** the second group (the reference group).
2. **Imitative Behavior**  
   * Members strive to be **like** the reference group or to make their own group resemble it in some way.
3. **Contrastive Identity**  
   * Members derive satisfaction from being **unlike** the reference group and **maintain that difference** consciously.
4. **Comparative Evaluation**  
   * Without striving to be like or unlike the reference group, members **use it as a standard** to evaluate themselves or their group.

### 4. Insights by Broom and Selznick

Broom and Selznick offer further depth to the concept:

> “Differences in social background affect perspectives, and therefore, opinions, because they make people sensitive to different things, provide experiences that give them feelings of weakness or strength, make them more or less verbal, more or less prone to join organized group."

Additional key points:

* People perceive themselves and the world through the **framework of the groups** they participate in.
* A person's reference group is **not necessarily** based on occupational role or economic class.
  * **Example**: Many **low-income individuals** accept and identify with **middle-class standards**.
* In **modern industrial societies** with **open communication channels**, individuals may adopt the **perspectives of both aspirational and actual groups**.
* Individuals may have **multiple reference groups**, each influencing opinions on **different subjects**.

### 5. Distinctions: Reference Groups vs. Other Group Types

* **Reference Groups vs. Social Categories**:
  * Social categories (e.g., **people with the same income**) are not inherently reference groups.
* **Reference Groups vs. Membership Groups**:
  * Membership groups (e.g., **trade unions**) may or may not function as reference groups.
* In opinion studies, it's essential to examine how social categories or membership groups **become reference groups**.

### 6. Additional Group Classifications

* **Voluntary vs. Involuntary Groups**:
  * **Voluntary groups**: Membership is based on **achieved status**.
  * **Involuntary groups**: Membership is **ascribed** (e.g., by **birth**, **caste**, **language**).
* **Size-Based Groups**:
  * **Dyad**: 2 individuals
  * **Triad**: 3 individuals
  * **And so on**, increasing in number
* **Structure-Based Groups**:
  * **Patterned Groups**:
    * Formally organized with **hierarchical structure**
    * Intended to **achieve specific goals**
  * **Non-Patterned Groups**:
    * **Informal organization**
    * No set rights or obligations among members

# **Social Stratification: Caste, Class & Estate**

### 1. Understanding Social Stratification

* Although **all men are born equal**, the idea of **equality** remains largely **utopian**.
* Most societies **categorize members** into **hierarchical groups** of **superiority** or **inferiority**.
* **Stratification** refers to the methods by which a society **ranks its members** in terms of:
  * **Class**
  * **Status**
  * **Power**
  * These align with the concepts of **class**, **caste**, and **estate**.

### 2. Exceptions to Stratification

* While stratification is common, there are also **unstratified groups**, such as:
  * **Play-groups of children**
  * **Close circles of old friends**
* Even **within a stratum**, **hierarchical relationships** of superiority/inferiority may not always exist.
* In some societies, stratification may be based **only on sex** or **personal qualities**, making it irrelevant to discuss **caste, class, and estate** in such contexts.

### 3. Roots of Social Stratification

* Social stratification arises from **social inequality**.
* Individuals differ based on **life chances** — opportunities and rewards conferred by society.
  * These include:
    * **Occupation**
    * **Health**
    * **Luxuries**
    * **Ethnicity** (as an important variable of differentiation)

* Since stratification involves **classification** and **evaluation**, considering all variables can result in **countless stratification patterns**.

### 4. Mobility and Criteria in Modern Stratification

* Some stratification systems allow **mobility** between strata; others **restrict** it completely.
* In modern societies, key criteria for stratification include:
  * **Family background** and **kinship bonds**
  * **Income**, **wealth**, and **occupation**
  * **Geographical location** and **duration of residence**
  * **Knowledge** and **educational status**

### 5. Status Consistency vs. Status Inconsistency

* **Status Consistency**: All criteria are **similarly ranked** (all high or all low).
* **Status Inconsistency**: Some criteria are **high**, others **low**.

### 6. Forms of Stratification (Based on Status Consistency)

Social stratification structures that reflect **status consistency** often take the form of:

* **Slavery**
* **Caste**
* **Class**
* **Estate**

> Each of these forms will be discussed briefly in the following sections.

---

## **Forms of Social Stratification**

---

## **Slavery**

* **Definition & History**:
  * Slavery is considered one of the **oldest institutions** in human history.
  * Some sociologists **disagree** with this classification, depending on the **criteria** used to define slavery.

* **Economic Basis**:
  * Slavery primarily has an **economic foundation**.
  * It is more common in societies where **labour is scarce or expensive**.

* **Modern Decline**:
  * The **decline of slavery** in recent times is linked to the rise of modern ideas such as:
    * **Rationality**
    * **Equality**
    * **Humanity**

---

## **Caste (Status Grouping)**

* **Definition**:
  * A caste system is a **normatively closed system** that relies entirely on **ascription of status**.
  * Society is divided into **hierarchically arranged social groups**, with **membership determined by birth**.

* **Global Presence**:
  * Though typically associated with **India**, caste-like systems are also found in:
    * **South Africa**: Historically divided on the basis of **ethnicity or colour**.
    * **East African Tribes**
    * The **Burakumin** minority group in **Japan**
    * Certain **European societies**

---

## **Caste System in India**

### **1. Origins of the Caste System**

* The origin of the caste system dates back to the age of the *Rg Veda*.
* The word *Varna* (meaning "colour") is used:
  * *Arya* is referred to as fair.
  * *Dasa* is referred to as dark.
* The *Purusa Sukta* (a part of the *Rg Veda*) describes the origin of the four varnas:
  * **Brahmins**: sprang from the **mouth** of the *Purusa* (god).
  * **Rajanyas**: from the **arms**.
  * **Vaisyas**: from the **thighs**.
  * **Sudras**: from the **feet**.

> **Note**: In this early period, these divisions were **functional**, not hereditary.
* There was:
  * Interchange of duties.
  * Interclass marriages.
  * No commensal taboos.
  * No trace of untouchability.

### **2. Developments During the Later Vedic Period**

* Gradual imposition of restrictions on:
  * Change of duties.
  * Social mobility.
* Key developments:
  * Further subdivisions within varnas.
  * **Birth** became the **sole criterion** of class determination.
  * The idea of **pollution by touch** emerged.

**Four Asramas (Life Stages)**
As mentioned in the *Zabala Upanisad*:
1. *Brahmacharya*
2. *Grahastha*
3. *Vanaprastha*
4. *Samnyasa*

* These life stages became closely associated with the caste system.

**Role of Dharma**
* *Dharma* (code of duties) was accepted for the harmonious functioning of societal divisions.
* *Dharma Sastra* laid down detailed rules for:
  * Each caste
  * Every vocation
  * All individuals in society

**Post-Gupta Period**
* Castes and subcastes became **rigidly separated**.
* Inter-caste relations became strictly regulated with respect to:
  * Dining
  * Marriage
  * Physical touch
  * Ritual observances
* The **category of outcastes** emerged.

### **3. Scholarly Perspectives on Caste**

**Common Features of Caste (According to Some Scholars):**
1. A common name
2. A common descent
3. Professed hereditary calling
4. A single homogeneous community

**Ketkar’s View**
* Emphasized:
  * **Hereditary membership**
  * **Endogamy**
* Saw caste as an **organic structure of relations**.

**G.S. Ghurye’s Comprehensive Definition -**
He identified **six main features** of the caste system:
1. Segmental division of society
2. Hierarchy of groups
3. Restrictions on feeding and social intercourse
4. Religious and allied disabilities and privileges for different sections
5. Lack of unrestricted choice of occupation
6. Restrictions on marriage

> **Endogamy** is highlighted as the **stable feature** of the caste system.

---

## **Origin of Caste**

### **Overview**
* Numerous theories have been proposed to explain the origin of caste in India.
* However, none fully explains the phenomenon.
* This summary is based on **Ram Ahuja (1993)**, who streamlines the discussion by excluding less substantiated theories such as geographical and evolutionary explanations.

### **1. Traditional Theory**

**Main Ideas**
* Caste system is divinely ordained or at least divinely approved.
* Seen as a **natural and normal system**.
* Based on **mythical origins**:
  * The four *varnas* emerged from different parts of **Brahma’s** body.
  * Caste is viewed as a natural organization of social functions.
  * Individual caste membership is explained through **Karma** and **Dharma** doctrines.

**Criticism**
* Rejected by scholars due to:
  1. Its assumption that caste is a natural phenomenon.
  2. Its equating of the four *varnas* with four castes.
* **Ram Ahuja**: The unit of the caste system is not *varna*, but *jati*.
* **M.N. Srinivas (1962)**: 
  > "The idea of caste as a four-fold division of society represents a gross oversimplification of facts."

### **2. Brahmanical Theory**

**Key Proponents**
* **Abbe Dubois**: Believes the caste system was a **Brahminical construct**.
  * Brahmins engineered restrictions (e.g., food, marriage, social relations) to:
    * Preserve ritual purity.
    * Maintain their **high status** and **special privileges**.
* **G.S. Ghurye (1961)**: 
  * Initial caste features developed from Brahmin efforts to **exclude Sudras** from religious and social life.

**Critique**
* **Hutton (1961)** offers a **critical perspective** on this theory.

## **3. Racial Theory**

**Main Proponent**
* **Herbert Risley**
**Other Supporters**
* **Ghurye**, **Majumdar**, **Westermarck**, and others.

**Core Argument**
* Castes in India crystallized through the **clash and contact of races**.
* Pattern observed historically:
  * Conquering groups marry into the conquered group selectively.
  * They **refuse to give their own daughters** in marriage.

**Counterpoint**
* If Risley’s theory were universally applicable, **caste-like systems** should exist in all societies affected by conquest.
* **Risley** himself claims caste is found in:
  * **South America**
  * **Canada**
  * **Mexico**, etc.

### **4. Uniqueness vs. Universality of Caste**

**Caste as a Unique Indian Phenomenon**
* Supported by scholars such as:
  * **Leach**, **Dumont**, **Pocock**, **Bougle**, **Hocart**, **Hutton**, **Senart**, **Srinivas**, **Gould**

**Caste as a Universal Phenomenon**
* Advocated by:
  * **Risley**, **Crook**, **Berreman**
* **Berreman**: Strongly argues for caste as a **universal principle of social stratification**.

**Balanced Perspective**
* Majority opinion:
  * Emphasizes **ethno-experience** (lived experience of caste) over theoretical models.
  * While caste is **unique to the Indian context**, **caste-like institutions** are observable globally.

### **5. Occupational Theory**

**Key Proponents**
* **Nesfield** (primary)
* Supported by **Denzil Ibbetson**

**Main Ideas**
* Technical skills of occupations were passed **hereditarily**.
* Long-term practice of the same occupation led to:
  * Formation of **occupational guilds**
  * These guilds evolved into **castes**.
* Caste hierarchy reflects perceived **superiority/inferiority of occupations**.

**Other Contributors**
* **Ketkar**
* **Senart**
* **Hutton**: Also contributed significantly to theories on caste origin.

## **Perspectives Regarding Caste**

### **1. Functionalist Perspective (Primarily British Ethnographers and Sociologists)**

* Most British ethnographers and sociologists viewed **caste as functional** to Indian society and culture.
* Emphasis was placed on:
  * Mutual relations between caste groups
  * Intra-caste harmony and discipline

**Key Contributors**
* **Risley**, **Ketkar**, **Senart**
* Functionalist perspective further developed by:
  * **Furnivall**
  * **Hulton**
  * **Sherring**  
  *(Sharma, 1986)*

**Other Thinkers**
* **Karl Marx**: Related caste to the **"Asiatic mode of production"**, emphasizing its **stability as a functional system**.
* **H.J.S. Maine**: Described caste as an example of a **non-contractual status-society** *(Sharma, 1980)*.

**Core Functionalist Assumptions**
1. Caste is **functional to society**, hence desirable.
2. Caste is **rigid and static**.

### **2. Criticisms of Functionalist Views**

**Sharma (1980)**
* Attributes British portrayal of caste to **colonial motives**:
  * To legitimize and justify **British rule**.
  * Presented caste as **all-inclusive** and **encompassing**.

**Sociological Critiques**
* Caste system is **inhuman** in organization and **exploitative** toward lower castes and untouchables.

### **3. Berreman’s Perspective (1979)**

* **Caste = rigid system of social stratification and socio-cultural pluralism**.
* Based on:
  * **Birth-ascribed groups**
  * **Hierarchical entitlements**
  * **Differential evaluation and rewards**
* **Access to goods and services** is tied to **rank in hierarchy**.
* **Rank** implies **inequality and dominance**, maintained by:
  * Those in **power and privilege**
  * **Conformity**, not consensus

**Quote Summary**
> The caste system is based on conformity brought about by power and privilege, not consensus.

### **4. Ambedkar’s Critique (1946)**

* Strongly **denounced caste hierarchy**.
* Criticized **Brahmanic concept of caste**.
* Highlighted its **inhuman and exploitative face**, especially through **untouchability**.

### **5. Caste: Rigid vs Dynamic**

* Although **rigid**, caste has **not been entirely static**.

**Support for Caste Dynamism**
* **Romila Thapar**, **K.M. Pannikar**, **Burton Stein**, **Imtiaz Ahmed**  
  *(Sharma, 1986)*
* **Harper**, **Rowe**, and **Stein**:
  * Studied patterns of **mobility** within caste system.
* **Rowe**:
  * Noted a *Sudra caste* (Nonlyas) gaining **partial Kshatriya status** within half a century due to **economic power**.
* **Burton Stein**:
  * Mentioned **social mobility** of low-ranking Sudras in the **15th century** *(Sharma, 1980)*.

**Sanskritization**
* Indicates **positional change**, not **structural change**.
* Caste system remained intact, enforced by **power-based conformity**.

### **6. Political Dimensions and Mobilization**

**Kothari (1970)**
* **Politicization of caste** leads to:
  * Outward-looking and upward-moving orientations
  * **Multiple memberships and overlapping identities**

**Paul Brass**, **Rudolph & Rudolph**
* In **Uttar Pradesh** and elsewhere:
  * **Dominant castes** engage in **vertical mobilization, factionalism, and personalism**
  * **Lower castes** use **horizontal mobilization** to challenge upper-caste elites  
  *(Sharma, 1980)*

### **7. Caste as Ideology: Louis Dumont**

* In *Homo Hierarchicus*, Dumont argued:
  * Caste inequality = **a special form of social inequality**
  * **Pure and impure** = basis of **caste hierarchy**
  * **Hierarchy** = **universal organizing principle** in India
  * Though **society changes**, **caste ideology remains static**

### **8. Structural and Cultural Views of Caste**

**Cultural Perspective**
* Caste seen as:
  * A **cultural system**
  * Focused on **pollution–purity**, **hierarchy**, **segregation**, and **corporateness**

**Structural Perspective**
* Caste as a **universal form of stratification**
* Emphasis on:
  * **Domination/subjugation**
  * **Privileges/deprivations**
  * **Surplus/exploitation**

**K.L. Sharma (1987)**
* Criticizes the cultural view for **ignoring interactional aspects** like:
  * *Jajman* and *Kamin*
* Structural view focuses on **power and material dimensions**

### **9. Caste and Class: Overlaps and Distinctions**

**Dumont**
* Indian society = **Caste Society**, not **Class Society**

**Andre Beteille**
* Worked on the **“caste model”** of Indian society

**K.L. Sharma**
* Argues caste and class are:
  * **Real and inseparable dimensions** of Indian social structure
  * **Concrete realities**, not just theoretical constructs

**Structural Components of Class**
* Landowners
* Landless laborers
* Traders
* Moneylenders

**Caste ≈ Class**
* **Upper castes** ≈ **High classes**
* **Lower castes** ≈ **Low classes**

### **10. Modern Changes in the Caste System**

* Caste system is **no longer as rigid** as in the past.
* Major agents of change:
  * **Urbanization**
  * **Industrialization**
  * **Westernization**
  * **Modernization**
  * **Sanskritization**

**Emerging Reality**
* Rise of **Dominant Castes** as a **substantive social force**

---

## **Related Concepts**

### **1. Social Mobility**

**Definition**
* **Social mobility** refers to the **movement of individuals, families, and groups from one social position to another**.
* A **social position or status** signifies a certain **rank** in relation to:
  * Possession of goods
  * Values esteemed and desired by most members of society

**P. Sorokin’s Contribution**
* Sorokin defined social mobility as:
  > “The shifting of people in social space.”
* He categorized social mobility based on:

**(a) Direction**
* **Vertical Mobility**: Movement up or down the social hierarchy
* **Horizontal Mobility**: Movement within the same social stratum (e.g., change in occupation without change in status)

**(b) Time-Space**
* **Inter-generational Mobility**: Change in status between generations (e.g., child achieving a higher/lower status than parents)
* **Intra-generational Mobility**: Change in status within an individual's own lifetime

**(c) Content**
* **Economic Mobility**: Change in wealth or income
* **Political Mobility**: Change in political power or influence
* **Occupational Mobility**: Change in profession or job role

### **2. Dominant Caste**

**M.N. Srinivas’s Concept**
* Introduced in his **Rampura village study**
* Defined **dominant caste** as a caste having significant control and influence over the **local social structure**

**Four Criteria of Dominance**
1. **Economic Strength**
2. **Numerical Strength** (in terms of population)
3. **Educational Advancement**
4. **Ritual Status**

* The dominant caste **exerts an overwhelming influence** in village or local affairs through a combination of these factors.

---

Here is your anthropology reading on **Class**, reorganized into a more structured and reader-friendly format while preserving the original content and terminology:

---

## **Class**

### **1. Definition and Nature**
* A **class system** is a **system of classification based on economic criteria**.
* A **social class** may be defined as:
  > A category of individuals sharing common economic status.
* A **class** is:
  * A **homogeneous group** of individuals
  * Sharing a **common economic situation**
  * Possessing **feelings of inferiority** toward those above them
  * Possessing **feelings of superiority** over those below them in class ranking

### **2. Class Status and Ranking**
* **Status ranking** of a class in a society depends on:
  * **Subjective criteria**
  * **Associated values**, which vary across societies
* For example:
  * One society may highly value **education**
  * Another may hold **technical professions** in high esteem

### **3. Achieved Status and Constraints**
* A **class** is primarily associated with **achieved status**.
* However, **racial-ethnic and sexual differences** may influence an individual's ability to achieve and move within the class system.
* Hence, although the **orientation of a class system is toward achievement**, in practice:
  * There may be **certain constraints** that limit mobility
### **4. Class-Specific Behaviour**
* Within a class-based society:
  * **Each class exhibits distinct modes of behaviour**
  * **Imitation** of one class's behavior by members of a different class is often **resented**

---

## **Estate**

### **1. Definition and Characteristics**
* The **Estate system** is often seen as **synonymous with feudalism**.
* **Status** within this system is determined by:
  * **Birth**
  * **Land ownership**
  * **Physical (military) force**

### **2. Structure of the Estate System**
* A **feudal estate** consisted of **three primary estates**:
  1. **Clergy** (*First Estate*) – ordained to pray for all
  2. **Aristocracy** (*Second Estate*) – ordained to defend all
  3. **Commoners** (*Third Estate*) – obliged to provide food for all
* These were not merely social categories but also **legal groupings**:
  * Each had specific **rights and obligations** towards the others

### **3. Historical Origins**
* The **Estate system arose in medieval Europe** due to:
  * **Disintegration of strong, stable governments**
  * **Decline in urban life**

### **4. Power Dynamics and Resource Control**
* **Nobility**:
  * Gained status through **land control**
  * More importantly, through **physical force**
* **Commoners**:
  * Had **obligations** but **no entitlements**
  * The **clergy and aristocracy** monopolized **resources and privileges**

### **5. Social Mobility**
* It was a **normatively closed system**:
  * **Mobility between estates was highly restricted**

### **6. Contemporary Existence**
* Though largely **disappeared globally**, remnants remain in limited regions:
  * **Latin American countries (e.g., Brazil)**:
    * **Large landholdings** persist
    * **Debt-burdened and dependent farmers** continue working for landowners
* In other regions, **land reforms** have significantly **eroded** the estate system

# **Perspectives on Social Stratification**

Various scholars and authorities in the field of social stratification have explained the subject through different perspectives. One of the most influential among them is **Karl Marx**.

## **Marx on Stratification**

**Economic Viewpoint:**
* **Karl Marx** emphasized the **economic basis** of social stratification.
* He stated:  
  > *"The history of (mankind) hitherto existing society is the history of class struggle."*

**Key Concepts:**
* **Class Antagonism**: Forms the basis of all **conflict and revolution**.
* **Classification of Classes** (based on access to resources):
  * **Capitalists**: Control the means of production.
  * **Landowners**: Distinguished from capitalists; seen as remnants of feudalism.
  * **Workers**: Sell their labour in exchange for wages.

**Terminology Introduced in *Communist Manifesto* (by Marx and Engels):**
* **Bourgeoisie**:
  > *"The class of modern capitalists, owners of the means of social production and employers of wage labour."*
* **Proletariat**:
  > *"The class of wage earners who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their labour power in order to live."*

### **2. Class Situations According to Marx**

(a) **Class-in-Itself**
* Members of the class:
  * Do **not understand** their **social position** or **class interests**.
  * Are fragmented by **intra-class rivalries**.
  * Are unable to engage in **class struggle**.

(b) **Class-for-Itself**
* Members are:
  * **Class conscious** and aware of their shared position.
  * United by **common class interests**.
  * Capable of engaging in **collective struggle** against oppressors.

---

### **3. Preconditions for Class Consciousness**  
(As outlined by **Morris Ginsberg**)
* **Greater chances of mobility** within society.
* **Rivalry and conflict** between different classes.
* **Strong community sentiment** within a class.

---

### **4. Marx’s Prediction and Historical Irony**

**Marx’s Vision:**
* Proletarians would eventually develop class consciousness.
* They would overthrow monopolistic capitalist regimes.
* This revolution would result in a **class-less society**.

**Historical Outcome:**
* Contrary to Marx's predictions:
  * The **industrialized societies of Europe** did **not** witness such revolutions.
  * Instead, revolutions occurred in countries like **Russia** and **China**, which:
    * Did **not meet** Marx's criteria of **class consciousness** and **industrial development**.
    * Yet underwent **communist revolutions**.

---

## **Weber and Stratification**

**Max Weber** built upon **Marx's** framework by analyzing **class situations** within the context of **industrialized societies** and **capitalism**, but he broadened the understanding of power and stratification.

### **1. Expansion of the Concept of Power**

* While **Marx** emphasized **economic power**, **Weber** expanded the concept to include:
  * **Economic factors**
  * **Social factors**
  * **Political factors**

> For Weber, **power** is not just about control over economic resources but also about the **social and political means** of influence.

### **2. Relationship Between Class and Status**

* **Class and status** are closely linked in Weber's theory.
* A person's **social class** influences their **social status**, which is often expressed through:
  * **Life-style**
  * **Consumption patterns**
  * **Prestige or honor** in the social order

### **3. Weberian Classification of Classes**

Weber identified multiple classes based on access to power and life chances. These are broader and more nuanced than Marx's binary classification:

* **Upper Class**  
* **Petty Bourgeoisie**  
* **White Collar Workers**  
* **Labour Class**

> Unlike Marx, who focused on the **bourgeoisie** and **proletariat**, Weber acknowledged the complexity and **stratified gradation** of modern societies.

---

## **Veblen and the Leisure Class**

**Thorstein Veblen** offered a unique perspective on the **class system** by introducing the concept of the **"leisure class."**

### **1. Emergence and Nature of the Leisure Class**

* According to **Veblen**, in nearly **all societies**, there have always been individuals who:
  * **Perform no productive role whatsoever**
  * **Survive on the labour of others**

* This group of privileged individuals constitutes what he termed the **leisure class**.

### **2. Characteristics of the Leisure Class**

* **Possess significant resources and wealth**
* Able to **enjoy life without engaging in any productive work**
* Serve **no meaningful societal function** beyond acting as a **reference group** for the general population (i.e., the commons)

### **3. Social Implications**

* The leisure class can serve as an **aspirational model**, influencing the behaviors and desires of the working masses.
* However, **Veblen cautioned** that:
  * If the leisure class grows **beyond a certain limit**, it may cause a **shortage in the productive workforce**.
  * This could ultimately lead to **scarcity of production units** within a society.

## **Functionalist Perspective on Social Stratification**

### **1. Theoretical Background**

* **Functionalist theories** of social stratification are best understood in the context of **functionalist theories of society** in general.
* These theories suggest that **stratification exists because it serves essential functions** in society.

### **2. Core Propositions**

* For stratification to persist, it must:
  * Fulfill **functional utilities**
  * Satisfy **societal prerequisites**
* Without stratification:
  * Certain **vital social functions** may go unfulfilled.
  * There would be **no system to ensure that the right person is placed in the right job**.

### **3. Key Functionalist Thinkers**

* Sociologists who contributed significantly to the functionalist viewpoint on stratification include:
  * **Émile Durkheim**
  * **Talcott Parsons**
  * **Melvin Tumin**
  * **Kingsley Davis**
  * **Robert K. Merton**

### **4. Important Interpretations and Quotes**

* According to **Haralambos**:
  > “The functionalist theories are primarily concerned with the function of social stratification, with its contribution to the maintenance and well-being of the society.”

* **Lipset** emphasizes:
  > “The stratification is perceived therefore as a motivation system; it is society’s mechanism for encouraging the most able people to perform the most demanding roles in order to have the society operate efficiently.”

### **5. Critical Note**

* It is important to recognize that:
  * **None of the theories** about social stratification are universally applicable to **all societies across all times**.

---

## **Stratification in Capitalist Society**

### **1. Economic and Occupational Stratification**
* While **economy** is a significant criterion for social stratification in modern capitalist society, **occupational status** is even more influential.
* **Frank Parkin** asserts:  
  > *"The backbone of class structure, and indeed the entire rewards system of modern Western society, is the occupational structure."*
  
### **2. Functionalist Perspective on Occupational Hierarchy**
* According to **functionalists**, occupations are stratified based on their:
  * Level of responsibility
  * Control over production resources
* As a result:
  * **Managerial, administrative, and professional occupations** are held in **higher esteem**.
  * **Unskilled, semiskilled, and even skilled manual jobs** are ranked lower.

### **3. Alternative Perspective: Power and Market Control**
* Another view emphasizes **power** over occupation.
* In a **market-based economy**, occupations that involve **control of the market** are more highly esteemed.
* Jobs requiring:
  * **High expertise**
  * **Specialized knowledge**
  * **High-quality work**
  * Are considered critical because those roles are **difficult to replace**.
* In contrast:
  * **Manual workers** are seen as **dispensable** and lack leverage over the product structure of society.

* **Parkin concludes**:  
  > *High occupational prestige is primarily the result of high occupational reward.*

---

### **The Middle Class in Capitalist Society**

**1. Emergence and Growth**
* The **middle class** is a **distinctive feature** of capitalist society.
* Although **Karl Marx** predicted the **middle strata** would eventually be forced into the **proletariat**, the **opposite trend** has occurred.
**2. Rise in Standard of Living**
* The living standards of:
  * **Unskilled workers**
  * **Skilled workers**
  * **White-collar employees**
  * Have **improved**, leading to an **expansion of the middle class**.
**3. Mechanisation and Occupational Shift**
* Due to **mechanisation** of the means of production:
  * **White-collar occupations** have become central in absorbing the labor force.
**4. Internal Diversity of the Middle Class**
* The middle class is **not homogeneous**, but a **conglomeration** of multiple layers:
  * **Lower middle class**: Includes skilled labor or semiskilled workers.
  * **Upper middle class**: Includes professional experts in managerial or administrative roles.

---

## **Stratification in Socialist Society**

### **1. Persistence of Social Classes**
* **Socialist countries** have **not succeeded** in creating a **classless society**.
* Despite **state control** over all production channels in socialist societies, **significant income disparities** exist across different occupations.
* These disparities are substantial enough to warrant a **discussion of social classes**.

### **2. General Classification of Classes**
* In a typical socialist society, social classes can be broadly categorized into:
  * **White-collar workers**
  * **Unskilled manual workers**

### **3. Income and Status Correlation**
* A **strong correlation** exists between:
  * **Income levels**
  * **Status rankings**
* This relationship mirrors that of capitalist societies, despite ideological differences.

### **4. Justifications for Social Ranking**
* Although **socialist societies** frequently **criticize social ranking** in capitalist systems, they **justify their own stratification** based on:
  * **Technological advancements**
  * **Diversification of occupations**

# **SOCIAL ORGANIZATION**

### **1. Definition and Nature**
* **Social organization** results from:
  * **Relationships among individuals**
  * **Interaction over time**, leading to firmly established social ties
* Each individual maintains **multiple types of relationships**
* **Social organization** provides **meaning to shared relationships**

**Components of Social Organization**
* Encompasses:
  * **Social entities** (relationships)
  * **Social processes** (interactions)
* Focusing on only one aspect (either entity or process) can result in a **vague understanding** of the subject

### **2. Cultural Influence and Complexity**
* A person's **behavior** in a given situation depends on:
  * Their **perception of the situation**, which is **learned through culture**
* Due to cultural variation:
  * There are **countless types of social relations and interactions**
  * It is **impossible to generalize** a typical social organization across human societies
* Social organization exists in:
  * **Real forms**
  * **Abstract forms**
  * This **dual nature** adds to the complexity of the topic

### **3. Major Processes of Social Organization**
Four primary processes characterize social organization:

**A. Social Ordering**
* Arises from **regular interaction** between social relationships, forming **predictable patterns over time**
* Involves **selecting specific relationships** for interaction via:
  * **Boundary creation** (either natural or artificial)
  * These boundaries **limit the circle of relationships**
* **Stability in social organization** depends on:
  * **Pattern stabilization**
  * Achieved through **ongoing development in relationships**

**B. Power Exertion**
* Power enables the **creation and maintenance** of social order
* Defined as the **ability to do something**
  * **Unrecognized power** = crime or sin
  * **Socially recognized power** = **authority**
* Power or authority is:
  * A function of **resources**
  * Used to **control other resources**
* Effective use of authority involves:
  * **Minimal coercion**
  * Encouraging **willing compliance**
  * Requires **ideal role performance**
* **Access to power** is limited:
  * Obtained through **strenuous procedures**
  * Those in power often **restrict access** to others

**C. Social Conflict**
* Previously discussed under:
  * **Role conflict**
  * **Conflict as a social process**
* Key types of conflict:
  * **Direct conflict**: Direct involvement of conflicting actors
  * **Mediated conflict**: Involves a **third party**
  * **Regulated conflict**: Follows **established norms**
  * **Unregulated conflict**: Lacks normative structure
  * **Expressive conflict**: Personal, emotional confrontation
  * **Instrumental conflict**: Over specific **issues or goals**
* Conflict is inherently **destructive**
  * Societies manage conflict through:
    * **Rigid organizations**
    * **Flexible organizations**

**D. Social Cohesion**
* Defined by **McGee** as:
  > *"The process through which component parts of an organization or organized entity are bound into a whole, almost synonymous with 'social solidarity'."*
* Two types:
  * **Functional cohesion**: Based on **task-specialization**
  * **Normative cohesion**: Based on **shared values**
* In most organizations:
  * Both types operate **simultaneously**
* Notably, **conflict in the larger society** can:
  * **Promote cohesion** within its **smaller units**

Certainly, Om! Below is your anthropology text on **Types of Social Organization**, reorganized into a clearer, more structured format. All original terminology and authorial intent have been faithfully preserved, with related ideas grouped logically under relevant headings and bullet points for readability.

## **Types of Social Organization**

### **1. Overview of Social Organization**
* **Social organization** includes all types of **groups within the societal structure**.
* Sociologists generally classify these groups into two broad categories:
  * **Formal organizations**
  * **Informal organizations**

### **2. Alternative Classification Criteria**
* Beyond the formal/informal dichotomy, groups can also be categorized based on:
  * **Caste**
  * **Class**
  * **Age**
  * **Sex**
  * **Occupation**
  * **Religion**
  * **Language**
  * **Region**

### **3. Formal Organizations**
**Key Characteristics:**
1. **Clearly defined norms** for members
2. When **formally registered**, they fall **under the jurisdiction of law** and can be legally regulated

### **4. Informal Organizations**
**Key Characteristics:**
* **Emerge naturally** where **strong group feeling** exists
* Not legally registered or formally structured

### **5. Overlap Between Formal and Informal Types**
* It can sometimes be **difficult to draw clear boundaries** between formal and informal organizations.
* Both types often **develop characteristics of the other** over time.

### **6. Scope of Discussion**
* The following discussion focuses on the **important types of social organizations** commonly found in most societies.

---

## **Recent Changes in Social Organization**

### **1. Theoretical Perspectives on Social Change**

Sociologists have long sought to explain changes in social organization. Notable contributions include:

* **Auguste Comte**:
  * Proposed that all social organization evolves through **three stages**:
    1. **Theological**
    2. **Metaphysical**
    3. **Scientific**
* **Ferdinand Tönnies**:
  * Described the shift from:
    * **Gemeinschaft** (community)
    * To **Gesellschaft** (society)
* **Émile Durkheim**:
  * Emphasized the rise of **organic solidarity**, resulting from increasing **interdependence and specialization**
* **Charles Darwin**:
  * His concept of **biological evolution** was also applied metaphorically to social organization
* **Karl Marx**:
  * Argued for an inevitable transformation from **capitalism** to **socialism**

> **Note**: Contemporary sociologists tend to **avoid absolute statements** about the trajectory of social change.

### **2. Observable Trends in Modern Social Organization**

**A. Growth in Western Societies (Especially the USA)**
Between the early 20th century and its third quarter, the United States experienced:

* **Population growth**: Approximately **280%**
* **Energy consumption per capita**: More than **doubled**
* **Gross National Product (GNP)**: Increased by **350%**
* **Number of government employees**: Rose by **1200%**

**B. Other Growth Indicators**
* Expansion in **size of business houses**
* Increase in the **number of associations**
* Many aspects of social organization, though difficult to quantify, have **grown significantly**

### **3. Increasing Complexity and Its Effects**

* Social organizations have not only grown in size but also in **complexity**
* **Specialization** has become standard, resulting in:
  * **Greater interaction** between sub-units
  * **Enhanced communication** within organizations
* **Roles and their interpretations** are evolving rapidly
* This growing complexity has led to **tensions and conflicts**, both:
  * **Within groups**
  * **Among groups**

### **4. Structural Shifts in Social Organization**

These trends have emphasized:

* **Bureaucratization**
* **Rationalization**
* **Centralization**

**Consequences**:

* Increased importance of **formal organizations**
* **Decline** in the role of **informal organizations**

---

# **Community**

### **1. Family and Community**
* While a **family** may appear self-sufficient and independent, it is **not an isolated social unit**.
* Families **form communities** when they:
  * **Share cultural values**
  * Are **influenced by other social factors**
  * Choose to **live together in proximity**

### **2. Definition of Community**

**Broom & Selznick’s Definition**:
> “A community is an inclusive group with two chief characteristics:  
> (1) within it the individual can have most of the experiences and conduct most of the activities that are important to him;  
> (2) it is bound together by a shared sense of belonging and by the feeling among its members that the group defines for them their distinctive identity.”  

* According to this definition:
  * A community member **lives his whole life** within the community
  * Experiences a **sense of kinship** with other members
  * Accepts the community as much as his own **name and family**

### **3. Basis of Community**

**A. Geographic or Locality-Based Communities**
* Typically based on **locality**, such as:
  * Village
  * City
  * Nation
* **Geographical area and sense of place**:
  * Set the **boundaries for common living**
  * Provide a **foundation for social solidarity**

**B. Non-Geographical Communities**
* Communities can also form around **non-territorial factors**, such as:
  * **Religion**
  * **Economy**
* Example:
  * **Catholic activities and institutions** enable many Catholics to live within religiously defined boundaries, regardless of location.

### **4. McGee’s Perspective**
> “A community is a type of social organization that is territorially located and provides the setting for dealing with most of the needs and problems of daily living.” — *McGee*

* This view emphasizes:
  * The **territorial aspect** of communities
  * Their role in addressing **daily life needs and problems**

### **5. Summary**
* Communities are **usually area-based**, but this is not an absolute requirement.
* One can also refer to **economically** or **religiously defined communities** that:
  * Are **spread across larger regions**
  * May **intermingle** with other communities

Here is your reformatted anthropology text on **Approaches to the Study of Community**, structured for better clarity and readability. The content remains fully intact and unaltered, Om.

---

## **Approaches to the Study of Community**

### **Overview**
A deeper analysis of definitions and literature on "community" reveals that there are **three main approaches** to its study:

---

### **1. Geographical Approach**
* Defines community as a **human settlement** within a **specific local territory**.
* Focus is on **ecological aspects** of the settlement.
* Characteristics:
  * Human interaction and interrelationships are **ignored**.
  * The settlement is viewed as **just one variable** in the human-environmental interaction.
* **Limitation**:  
  * This approach lacks an anthropological perspective because it does not explore what transpires **within** the human grouping.

---

### **2. Social System Approach**
* Views community as a **set of social relationships** within a locality.
* Emphasizes:
  * **Interrelationships** between individuals and groups.
  * The **social structure** within a defined territory.
* Characteristics:
  * Focuses on **how** people relate to one another, not necessarily the **content** or nature of these relationships.

---

### **3. Relational or Communon Approach**
* The **most recent** and advanced perspective.
* Does **not rely on territory** for defining a community.
* Focuses on:
  * A particular type of **bond** or **relation** between individuals.
  * A **sense of identity** and **shared experiences** among members.
* Characteristics:
  * Emphasizes **meaningful identity** based on shared **criteria**, **factors**, or **past experiences**.
  * Even individuals who are **geographically dispersed** may belong to the same community.
* Referred to as **"communon"**, highlighting the relational and experiential nature of the community.

---

### **Understanding Community in Practice**

**Key Points**
* **Community living** is **fundamental** to human society.
* Individuals do **not live in society** as a whole, but within **smaller groups** like families and communities.
* **Community is given** to individuals from **birth**.
  * One does **not usually choose** their community.
  * There is **limited agency** in community selection.

**Contextual Nature of Community**
* Community is **contextual** and **multi-layered**.
* Every individual typically belongs to **multiple communities** at the same time.
* **Common bases** of community reference include:
  * Place of birth
  * Place of residence
  * Caste
  * Religion
  * Language
  * Education
  * Wealth

---

## **Features of a Community**

A *community* is defined by the following **three key features**, which also serve as its **essential elements**:

1. **Population**  
   * The group of people who constitute the community.
2. **Territory/Locality**  
   * A defined geographical space or area in which the community resides.  
   * **Note**: This feature does **not** apply to *communon* (a type of community based on shared identity rather than location).
3. **Common Code of Conduct**  
   * A set of shared norms, rules, or behavioral expectations followed by members.

> All **three elements together** constitute the idea of a *Community*.

## **Characteristics of a Community**

The main characteristics commonly associated with communities include:

* **Sense of Belongingness**  
  * A strong emotional or psychological connection to the group.
* **Distinctive Identity**  
  * A unique cultural, social, or symbolic identity that sets the group apart.
* **Common Living**  
  * Shared experiences and activities that reinforce social bonds.
* **Interdependence**  
  * Mutual reliance among members for needs, support, and cooperation.
* **Likeness**  
  * Similarities in culture, values, lifestyle, or interests among members.
* **Self-sufficiency**  
  * The ability to meet most needs internally, without external support.  
  * **Note**: This feature is **not applicable** to **larger communities**, such as *urban communities*.

---

## **Types of Community**

There are various typologies of community proposed by different groups of scholars. These classifications are based on **diverse criteria**, including economic, social, and religious factors.

### **1. Economic Criterion**

This classical approach to community classification focuses solely on economic aspects. Communities under this category include:

1. **Peasant Community**  
2. **Little Community**  
3. **Rural Community**  
4. **Urban Community**

### **2. Social Criterion**

The social approach considers the nature and purpose of relationships among individuals within specific groups. Examples include:

* **Students’ Community**  
* **Intellectuals’ Community**  
* **Workers’ Community**

### **3. Religious Criterion**

Communities defined by shared faith or religious affiliation fall under this category, such as:

* **Hindu Community**  
* **Muslim Community**  
* **Catholic Community**  
* **Protestant Community**

### **Approaches to Classification**

* The **classical approach** is primarily based on **economic criteria**.
* The **modern approach** integrates both **social and economic criteria**, resulting in a more inclusive understanding of community.

> However, the **modern approach** has broadened the meaning of the term *community*, sometimes leading to **conceptual contradiction**.

## **Comparison between Society and Community**

### **Key Differences Between Society and Community**

1. **Size and Composition**  
   * **Society**: A very large human grouping, consisting of smaller groups like communities, families, and associations.
   * **Community**: A smaller, more localized group.
2. **Abstract vs. Experiential**  
   * **Society**: An abstract, non-tangible reality.
   * **Community**: A real, experiential, and substantive entity.
3. **Geographical Reference**  
   * **Community**: Often defined with reference to a **locality** (specific geographic area).
   * **Society**: Does **not** have a geographical boundary; it is **area-less**.
4. **Role in Human Living and Socialization**  
   * **Community**: Fundamental to **human living** and **socialization**.
   * **Society**: Influences indirectly, playing a more overarching role.
5. **Expression of Sentiments**  
   * **Community**: Sentiments, emotions, and feelings find expression here.
   * **Society**: Does **not** serve as the primary space for the expression of personal sentiments.
6. **Homogeneity vs. Heterogeneity**  
   * **Community**: Characterized by **homogeneity** (similar values, culture, etc.).
   * **Society**: Full of **heterogeneity** (diverse individuals and groups).
7. **Self-Sufficiency**  
   * **Community**: May **not** be self-sufficient due to its limitations.
   * **Society**: Tends to be **self-sufficient**, encompassing all the resources and support systems needed.

Here is the reformatted text on **Rural and Urban Communities** with improved readability and structure:

---

## **Rural and Urban Communities**

### **Introduction**
* Most communities in the world today can be categorized as either rural or urban.
* Historically, humans have lived in rural settings for most of their existence, while cities have emerged only recently with the rise of industrialization and urbanization in the 19th century.
  
### **Criteria for Characterizing Rural and Urban Communities**
* **Variation in Criteria**:
  * Different countries use different criteria to define a community as rural or urban.
  * Examples:
    * In **France**, a community with a population over **2,000** is considered urban.
    * In the **United States**, **Netherlands**, and **Japan**, the thresholds are **2,500**, **20,000**, and **30,000**, respectively.
  * The inconsistency in population thresholds makes this classification system somewhat unreliable.
  * In many countries, such as **India**, geographic location may not be a clear indicator of whether a community is rural or urban.

### **Indian Classification**
* In India, rural and urban life is defined more distinctly:
  * A community is considered **urban** if:
    1. It is controlled by a **Municipality** or **Municipal Corporation**, or is under a **Cantonment** or **Notified Area Committee**.
    2. **Urban Community Features (Census of India)**:
       * Population density: at least **1,000 people per square mile**.
       * Total population: not less than **5,000**.
       * **At least 75%** of the employed population should be involved in **non-agricultural pursuits**.

### **Sociological Distinctions**
* **Urban vs. Rural Communities**:
  * In **sociological terms**, urban and rural communities can be distinguished by their **community life** and the **attitudes** of their members.
  * **Rural Community**:
    * Primarily agricultural-based, farming is both an **economic activity** and a **way of life**.
    * The community is more **homogeneous** due to limited variability in lifestyle and activities.
    * **Primary-group relationships** (i.e., face-to-face interactions) are more prevalent.
    * **Fierce competition** is often absent, contributing to a **traditional conservative outlook**.
    * Strong **socio-psychological bonds** exist between members.
  * **Urban Community**:
    * Less dependent on personal relationships; more **open** and less reliant on community bonds.
    * **Face-to-face interaction** is less common, with formal relationships being more important.
    * **Formal social control** mechanisms are more typical in urban settings.

### **Micro-Level Differences: Rural vs. Urban**
* **Rural Community**:
  * Characterized by **strong socio-psychological bonds** and a high level of **interdependence**.
  * **Limited variability** in activities and lifestyle, contributing to **homogeneity**.
* **Urban Community**:
  * **Open society**, with individuals having less dependence on others.
  * **Formal relationships** and **formal means of social control** are more common.
  
### **Macro-Level Differences**
* **Town vs. Region**:
  * **Towns** often exhibit features of both **rural** and **urban** communities, showing a blend of the two.
  * A **region**, generally larger than a city, may or may not have the same level of **heterogeneity** as an urban area.
  
### **Transformation from Rural to Urban**
* The transformation process typically includes the following steps:
  1. **Increase in occupational specialization**.
  2. The release of some individuals from direct productive work, leading to the **elevation to a priesthood**.
  3. The transformation of **religious activities** (e.g., related to fertility, rainfall, water supply) into more **administrative roles** (e.g., managing irrigation systems and land).
  4. The emergence of **political leadership** and **management of labor forces**.
  5. **Differential rewards** for different tasks.
  6. Assigning part of the workforce to **ensure food supply continuity** and **defend the city** from external threats.
  7. Establishment of a **market for goods exchange**.

---

# **Associations**

### **Definition and Purpose**
* **Communities** perform a wide range of functions, while **associations** are formed for specific, defined purposes.
* Associations are **deliberate creations**, formed to achieve particular goals. They are typically based on **limited interests** and are often **utilitarian** in nature.
  
### **Types of Associations**
Associations can be grouped based on their objectives and purposes:
1. **Mutual Benefit Associations**:
   * Examples: **Clubs**, **Trade unions**.
2. **Business Associations**:
   * Examples: **Financial institutions**, **Industries**.
3. **Commonwealth Associations**:
   * Examples: **Public libraries**, **Federal government**.
4. **Service Associations**:
   * Examples: **Schools**, **Hospitals**.

### **Size of Associations**
* The size of an association can vary greatly, ranging from:
  * A **few persons** to **hundreds**, **thousands**, or even **millions**.
* The **numerical strength** of an association depends on its **purpose** and how significantly it affects people.
* **Complex associations** often have **multiple aims** and the goals of an association may evolve over time due to changing circumstances or resources.
   * **Example**: The **Indian National Congress** was initially formed as a **welfare association** but later became the leading movement for the country’s **freedom**.

### **Adaptability of Associations**
* Associations are highly **adaptable**:
  * Their **size**, **organization**, and **goals** can change when necessary.
  * If the members feel that the association has outlived its usefulness, they can choose to **end** it.
* This flexibility is one reason for the **plethora of associations** found in most societies, particularly in **complex societies**.

Here is the reformatted version of the text on **Institutions**, structured for better readability:

---

# **Institutions**

### **Definition and Importance**
* Every **social organization** must meet certain basic needs to ensure its survival and efficiency.
* These needs give meaning to the organization and help it perform essential functions that maintain its credibility.

### **Functions of Social Organizations** (as identified by McGee)
An organization must perform several core functions, including:
* **Maintaining the population**.
* **Training new members**.
* **Providing channels of communication**.
* **Assigning roles and tasks**.
* **Establishing social norms and operational rules**.
* **Procuring necessary resources** from the environment.
* **Making collective decisions**.
* **Coordinating internal activities**.
* **Controlling deviant actions**.
* **Defending against external threats**.

### **Institutions and Normative Patterns**
* These functions can be performed in various ways within a societal framework. However, organizations tend to follow certain ways (through **chance** or **experience**) to achieve their goals.
* The **persistent normative patterns** adhered to by members of a social organization are called **institutions**.
* **Definition of Institution**:
  * An institution is a **persistent normative pattern** of interrelated organizations concerned with a particular functional requirement.
  * Institutions share common activities and norms but are not just isolated behavioral patterns—they are **integral parts** of the organization.

### **Why Institutions Exist**
* The reason why some norms are followed by social organizations and others are not can be understood through discussions by **Broom and Selznick**.
* **Public Interests**:
  * **Cultural values**: These are the beliefs and actions that define a society’s identity, forming its "way of life" (e.g., Americans value churchgoing, public education, and equal justice before the law).
  * **Social order**: Institutions regulate internal conflicts and ensure the community’s safety from external threats (e.g., government institutions).
  * Other public interests include promoting **economic welfare**, **science**, **public health**, and **peace**.
* **Public interest** becomes urgent when:
  * A **key value** is affected.
  * **Social order** is at risk.

### **Characteristics of Institutions**
1. **Control of individuals**: Institutions serve as means of controlling individual behavior.
2. **Collective activities**: They depend on the collective activities of people.
3. **Established procedures**: Institutions operate based on customs and dogmas, with defined proceedings.
4. **Stability**: Institutions are more stable than other forms of social control.
5. **Rules**: Institutions have rules that **must be obeyed** by individuals.
6. **Symbols**: Institutions have **symbols** (either material or non-material).
7. **Satisfy primary needs**: Institutions are formed to address the primary needs of individuals.

### **Functioning of Institutions**
* An institution can be thought of as a **network of procedures** centered on a focal interest, with the focal interest varying for different institutions.
* For effective functioning, **every society needs organized sets of roles**, **traditions**, **goals**, and other elements that form institutions.
* **Organization of institutions** may differ across societies, but the fundamental need for such institutions remains universal.
