# Chapter 1: Constitution - Why and How?

## Introduction

This book explores the working of the Indian Constitution. You will learn about various institutions of government and their relationships with each other. The entire structure of government and the principles that bind governmental institutions have their origin in the **Constitution of India**.

### Learning Objectives
After studying this chapter, you will learn:
- What a constitution means
- What a constitution does to society
- How constitutions govern the allocation of power in society
- How the Constitution of India was made

---

## Why Do We Need a Constitution?

### Understanding Constitutional Need Through Society

Imagine a diverse group with members having:
- Different religious allegiances (Hindus, Muslims, Christians, or no religion)
- Various professions, abilities, and interests
- Different economic backgrounds (rich and poor)
- Different age groups

This group faces potential disputes over:
- Property ownership limits
- Educational policies for children
- Resource allocation (security vs. parks)
- Discrimination issues

**Key Question**: What enables such a diverse group to live together peacefully?

**Answer**: Basic rules that are publicly known and enforceable.

---

## Functions of a Constitution

### 1. Coordination and Assurance

**The First Function**: A constitution provides a set of basic rules that allow for minimal coordination amongst members of society.

**Why Basic Rules Are Essential**:
- Without rules, individuals would be insecure
- People wouldn't know what others might do to them
- No clarity on rights and claims
- Rules must be publicly promulgated and known to all
- Rules must be enforceable to ensure compliance

### 2. Specification of Decision-Making Powers

**The Second Function**: A constitution specifies who has the power to make decisions in a society and decides how the government will be constituted.

**Key Constitutional Questions**:
- Who gets to decide what laws should govern society?
- How should people decide on laws?
- Should everyone agree for something to become law?
- Should people vote directly or through representatives?
- How should representatives be elected and organized?

**Example - Indian Constitution**:
- Parliament gets to decide laws and policies in most instances
- Parliament itself is organized in a particular manner
- The constitution provides the authority that constitutes government

### 3. Limitations on Government Powers

**The Third Function**: A constitution sets limits on what a government can impose on its citizens. These limits are fundamental and government may never trespass them.

**Methods of Limiting Government Power**:
- **Fundamental Rights**: Basic rights that all citizens possess
- **Protected Liberties**: Freedom of speech, conscience, association, trade, etc.
- **Legal Safeguards**: Protection from arbitrary arrest
- **Emergency Provisions**: Circumstances under which rights may be temporarily withdrawn

### 4. Aspirations and Goals of Society

**The Fourth Function**: A constitution enables the government to fulfill the aspirations of a society and create conditions for a just society.

**Modern Constitutional Innovation**:
- Twentieth-century constitutions (especially Indian Constitution) provide enabling frameworks
- Governments empowered to take positive measures
- Address deep-rooted inequalities and deprivation

**Examples of Aspirational Provisions**:

**India**: 
- Freedom from caste discrimination
- Minimal dignity and social self-respect for all
- Material well-being and education
- Supported by Preamble, Fundamental Rights, and Directive Principles

**South Africa**: 
- Conservation of nature
- Protection from unfair discrimination
- Adequate housing and healthcare

**Indonesia**: 
- National education system
- Care for poor and destitute children

### 5. Fundamental Identity of a People

**The Fifth Function**: A constitution expresses the fundamental identity of a people.

**Three Aspects of Constitutional Identity**:

1. **Collective Identity**: People form collective identity through agreeing to basic constitutional norms
2. **Moral Identity**: Constitutional norms provide overarching framework for individual aspirations within defined moral boundaries  
3. **National Identity**: Constitutions embody different conceptions of national identity and citizenship

**Examples of Different National Identities**:
- **German Constitution**: Based on ethnic German identity
- **Indian Constitution**: Does not make ethnic identity a criterion for citizenship
- Various approaches to center-region relationships define national identity

## The Authority of a Constitution

### Three Key Questions About Constitutions

1. **What is a constitution?**
2. **How effective is a constitution?**
3. **Is a constitution just?**

### What Makes a Constitution Effective?

#### 1. Mode of Promulgation

**Critical Factors**:
- Who crafted the constitution?
- How much authority did they have?
- Do they have popular support?

**Successful Examples**:
- **India, South Africa, United States**: Created after popular national movements
- **Indian Constitution**: Drew legitimacy from credible leaders with public support
- Leaders had capacity to negotiate and command respect across society
- Final document reflected broad national consensus

**Contrast with Failed Constitutions**:
- Constitutions by military leaders or unpopular leaders often remain defunct
- Lack of popular backing leads to ineffective constitutions

#### 2. Substantive Provisions

**Key Principle**: A successful constitution gives everyone in society some reason to support its provisions.

**Requirements for Success**:
- No permanent majorities oppressing minorities
- No systematic privileging of some groups over others
- Protection of diverse identities
- Framework for pursuing basic justice
- Preservation of freedom and equality for all members

**Thought Experiment**: What basic rules would give everyone reason to support them?

#### 3. Balanced Institutional Design

**Fragmentation of Power**:
- **Horizontal Fragmentation**: Power distributed across Legislature, Executive, Judiciary, and independent bodies like Election Commission
- **Checks and Balances**: Multiple institutions can check each other's transgressions
- Prevention of any single institution subverting the Constitution

**Balance Between Stability and Flexibility**:
- Constitution must be authoritative yet adaptable
- Too rigid: breaks under pressure of change
- Too flexible: provides no security or predictability
- **Indian Constitution**: Successfully balances core values with adaptability to new circumstances

### Three Tests for Constitutional Authority

1. **Credibility Test**: Were the constitution makers credible?
2. **Institutional Design Test**: Does the constitution prevent any group from subverting it?
3. **Justice Test**: Does the constitution give everyone reason to support it?

- Congress itself accommodated diverse opinions

### Key Constitutional Quote

> **Dr. B.R. Ambedkar on Social Democracy**:
> 
> "We must make our political democracy a social democracy as well. Political democracy cannot last unless there lies at the base of it social democracy. What does social democracy mean? It means a way of life, which recognises liberty, equality and fraternity as the principles of life. These principles of liberty, equality and fraternity are not to be treated as separate items in a trinity. They form a union of trinity in the sense that to divorce one from the other is to defeat the very purpose of democracy. Liberty cannot be divorced from equality, equality cannot be divorced from liberty. Nor can liberty and equality be divorced from fraternity. Without equality, liberty would produce the supremacy of the few over the many. Equality without liberty would kill individual initiative. Without fraternity, liberty and equality could not become a natural course of things…"

## Principles That Made the Constitution Effective

### 1. The Principle of Deliberation

**Deliberative Excellence**:
- Members represented not just their communities but the whole nation
- Disagreements based on principles, not personal interests
- Sophisticated discussion of fundamental issues:
  - Centralized vs. decentralized government
  - State-center relations
  - Judicial powers
  - Property rights

**Unanimous Decision**: Universal suffrage (voting rights regardless of religion, caste, education, gender, or income) - passed without debate, showing democratic commitment.

**Public Reason**:
- Members engaged in reasoned argument
- Gave principled reasons for positions
- Moved beyond narrow self-interest
- Voluminous debates subjected each clause to scrutiny
- Debates comparable to French and American constitutional conventions

### 2. Systematic Procedures

**Committee Structure**:
- **Eight Major Committees** on different subjects
- **Committee Chairs**: Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajendra Prasad, Sardar Patel, B.R. Ambedkar
- Despite personal disagreements, leaders worked together collaboratively

**Working Method**:
- Each committee drafted specific constitutional provisions
- Provisions debated by entire Assembly
- Consensus-building approach
- Every argument and concern addressed in writing
- **Duration**: 166 days over 2 years and 11 months
- **Transparency**: Sessions open to press and public

### Quote on Dr. Ambedkar's Leadership

> **Dr. Rajendra Prasad on Dr. Ambedkar**:
>
> "I have realised as nobody else could have, with what zeal and devotion the members of the Drafting Committee and especially its Chairman, Dr. Ambedkar in spite of his indifferent health, have worked. We could never make a decision which was or could be ever so right as when we put him on the Drafting Committee and made him its Chairman. He has not only justified his selection but has added lustre to the work which he has done."
>
> *CAD, Vol. XI, p.994, November 26, 1949*

### 3. Inheritance of the Nationalist Movement

**Background Consensus**:
- Constituent Assembly built on principles forged during freedom struggle
- Decades of debate on:
  - Shape and form of government
  - Values to uphold
  - Inequalities to overcome
- Constitution gave concrete form to nationalist movement principles

**Objectives Resolution (1946)**:
Moved by Nehru, this resolution encapsulated constitutional aspirations and values.

### Main Points of the Objectives Resolution

**Key Arrangements Adopted**:
- **Parliamentary Form**: Balance between legislature and executive
- **Federal System**: Distribution of powers between states and central government
- **Separation of Powers**: Among executive, legislature, and judiciary

### Learning from Global Experience

**International Borrowing**: Constitution makers studied worldwide constitutional experiments.

**Approach to Borrowing**:
- Not slavish imitation
- Each provision defended on grounds of suitability to Indian problems
- Adaptations made to remove faults and accommodate Indian needs

### Dr. Ambedkar on Constitutional Innovation

> **On Borrowing Constitutional Ideas**:
>
> "One likes to ask whether there can be anything new in a Constitution framed at this hour in the history of the world… The only new things, if there can be any, in a Constitution framed so late in the day are the variations made to remove the faults and to accommodate it to the needs of the country."
>
> *CAD, Vol. VII, p.37, November 4, 1948*

# Chapter 2: Rights in the Indian Constitution

## Introduction

A constitution is not only about the composition of the various organs of government and the relations among them. As we studied in the last chapter, the constitution is a document that sets limits on the powers of the government and ensures a democratic system in which all persons enjoy certain rights. 

In this chapter, we shall study the Fundamental Rights contained in the Indian Constitution. Part three of the Constitution of India lists the Fundamental Rights and also mentions the limits on these rights. In the past six decades, the scope of rights has changed and in some respects, expanded.

### Learning Objectives
After studying this chapter, you would know:
- What are the various Fundamental Rights listed in the Constitution of India
- How these rights are protected
- What role the judiciary has played in protecting and interpreting these rights
- What is the difference between the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles of State Policy

## The Importance of Rights

### Case Study 1: Construction Workers' Rights (1982)
During the construction work for Asian Games, the government engaged contractors who employed a large number of very poor construction workers from different parts of the country to build flyovers and stadiums. These workers were kept in poor working conditions and were paid less than the minimum wages decided by the government.

A team of social scientists studied their poor condition and petitioned the Supreme Court. They argued that employing a person to work for less than the minimum prescribed wage amounts to *begar* or forced labour, which is a violation of the Fundamental Right against exploitation. The court accepted this plea and directed the government to ensure that thousands of workers get the prescribed wages for their work.

### Case Study 2: Machal Lalung's Tragic Story
Machal Lalung was 23 when he was arrested. A resident of Chuburi village of Morigaon district of Assam, Machal was charged of causing grievous injuries. He was found mentally too unstable to stand trial and was sent as under trial to Lok Priya Gopinath Bordoloi Mental Hospital in Tejpur for treatment.

Machal was treated successfully and doctors wrote twice to jail authorities in 1967 and 1996 that he was fit to stand trial. But no one paid any attention. Machal Lalung remained in "judicial custody." He was released in July 2005. He was 77 then. **He spent 54 years under custody during which his case never came up for hearing.**

He was freed when a team appointed by the National Human Rights Commission intervened after an inspection of undertrials in the State. Machal's entire life was wasted because a proper trial against him never took place. Our Constitution gives every citizen the right to 'life and liberty': this means that every citizen must also have the right to fair and speedy trial. Machal's case shows what happens when rights granted by the Constitution are not available in practice.

### The Significance of These Cases
In the case of the construction workers, there was violation of rights provided in the Constitution, but it was challenged in the court. As a result, workers could get what was due to them in the form of their rightful wages. The constitutional guarantee of the right against exploitation ensured justice to these workers.

### Bill of Rights - Concept and Definition
Both these examples show the importance of having rights and of the actual implementation of these rights. A democracy must ensure that individuals have certain rights and that the government will always recognise these rights. 

**Bill of Rights**: A list of rights mentioned and protected by the constitution. A bill of rights prohibits government from acting against the rights of the individuals and ensures a remedy in case there is violation of these rights.

#### From whom does a constitution protect rights?
The rights of a person may be threatened by:
- Another person or private organisation (requiring government protection)
- Organs of the government itself (legislature, executive, bureaucracy, or judiciary) in the course of their functioning

## Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution

### Historical Background
During our freedom struggle, the leaders of the freedom movement had realised the importance of rights and demanded that the British rulers should respect rights of the people. The Motilal Nehru committee had demanded a bill of rights as far back as in 1928. 

When India became independent and the Constitution was being prepared, there were no two opinions on the inclusion and protection of rights in the Constitution. The Constitution listed the rights that would be specially protected and called them **'Fundamental Rights'**.

### What Makes Rights "Fundamental"?
The word fundamental suggests that these rights are so important that the Constitution has separately listed them and made special provisions for their protection. The Fundamental Rights are so important that the Constitution itself ensures that they are not violated by the government.

#### Key Characteristics of Fundamental Rights:
- **Constitutional Protection**: Protected and guaranteed by the constitution of the country (unlike ordinary legal rights protected by ordinary law)
- **Amendment Protection**: May only be changed by amending the Constitution itself (unlike ordinary rights that can be changed by legislature through ordinary law-making process)
- **Government Limitation**: No organ of the government can act in a manner that violates them
- **Judicial Protection**: Judiciary has the powers and responsibility to protect fundamental rights from violations by government actions
- **Reasonable Restrictions**: Not absolute or unlimited rights; government can put reasonable restrictions on their exercise

### International Comparison: South African Bill of Rights

The South African Constitution was inaugurated in December 1996. Its creation took place when South Africa still faced the threat of civil war after the dissolution of the Apartheid government. The South African Constitution says that its "Bill of Rights is a cornerstone of democracy in South Africa".

#### Rights in South African Constitution:
- **Anti-Discrimination**: Forbids discrimination on grounds of "race, gender, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language and birth"
- **Comprehensive Rights**: Perhaps the most extensive range of rights to citizens
- **Special Enforcement**: A special constitutional court enforces the rights

**Some specific rights included:**
- Right to Dignity
- Right to Privacy
- Right to fair labour practices
- Right to healthy environment and right to protection of environment
- Right to adequate housing
- Right to health care, food, water and social security
- Children's rights
- Right to basic and higher education
- Right of cultural, religious and linguistic communities
- Right to information

## The Six Categories of Fundamental Rights

### 1. Right to Equality

#### Core Provisions:
- **Equality before law** - equal protection of laws
- **Prohibition of discrimination** on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth
- **Equal access** to shops, hotels, wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads etc.
- **Equality of opportunity** in public employment
- **Abolition of Untouchability**
- **Abolition of titles**

#### Understanding Equality through Examples
Consider these situations involving violation of fundamental rights:

**Example 1**: Swadesh Kumar is visiting his village with a friend. At a roadside hotel, the shopkeeper serves tea to Swadesh Kumar in a nice mug while his friend was given tea in an earthen cup because he was dalit.

**Example 2**: Four female newsreaders of a television channel are told they would no longer read news on screen because they are above age forty-five. Two male newsreaders above the same age continue presenting news.

These are examples of clear discrimination based on caste and gender respectively.

#### The Preamble and Equality
The Preamble mentions two aspects of equality:
- **Equality of status**
- **Equality of opportunity**

#### Special Provisions and Reservations
The Constitution clarifies that the government can implement special schemes and measures for improving the conditions of certain sections of society: children, women, and the socially and educationally backward classes.

**Article 16(4)** explicitly clarifies:
> "Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the services under the State."

### 2. Right to Freedom

Equality and freedom (liberty) are the two rights that are most essential to a democracy. Liberty means freedom of thought, expression and action. However, it does not mean freedom to do anything that one desires - freedoms are defined so that every person can enjoy freedom without threatening others' freedom or endangering law and order.

#### Right to Life and Personal Liberty
**Article 21**: Protection of life and personal liberty
> "No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law."

**Key Protections:**
- No citizen can be denied life except by procedure laid down under law
- No one can be arrested without being told the grounds for arrest
- Right to defend oneself by a lawyer of choice
- Police must take arrested person to nearest magistrate within 24 hours
- Magistrate (independent of police) decides if arrest is justified

**Expanded Scope through Supreme Court Judgments:**
The Supreme Court has expanded this right to include:
- Right to live with human dignity, free from exploitation
- Right to shelter and livelihood (as no person can live without means of living)

#### Preventive Detention
Sometimes a person can be arrested out of apprehension that they might engage in unlawful activity, without following normal arrest procedures. This is **preventive detention**.

**Provisions:**
- Government can detain someone if they feel the person is a threat to law and order or national security
- Can be extended only for three months
- After three months, case goes before advisory board for review

**Concerns:** This provision has often been misused by governments, creating tension between right to life/liberty and preventive detention powers.

#### Other Freedoms Under Right to Freedom:
- **Freedom of speech and expression** (subject to restrictions like public order, peace, morality)
- **Freedom to assemble** (peacefully and without arms)
- **Freedom to form associations/unions**
- **Freedom to move freely** throughout India's territory
- **Freedom to reside and settle** in any part of India
- **Freedom to practice any profession** or carry on occupation, trade, business

#### Rights of the Accused
The Constitution ensures protection for persons accused of offences:
- **No double jeopardy**: No person punished for same offence more than once
- **No ex-post facto law**: No law shall declare any action illegal from a backdate
- **Protection against self-incrimination**: No person shall be asked to give evidence against themselves

#### Constituent Assembly Debate on Restrictions

> "I feel that many of these fundamental rights have been framed from the point of view of a police constable… you will find that very minimum rights have been conceded and are almost invariably followed by a proviso. Almost every article is followed by a proviso which takes away the right almost completely... What should be our conception of fundamental rights?...We want to incorporate every one of those rights which our people want to get."
> 
> **- Somnath Lahiri, CAD, Vol. III, p. 404, 29 April 1947**

### 3. Right Against Exploitation

In our country there are millions of underprivileged and deprived people who may be subjected to exploitation by fellow human beings.

#### Key Prohibitions:
- **Prohibition of traffic in human beings and forced labour**
- **Prohibition of employment of children** in hazardous jobs

#### Forms of Exploitation Addressed:
- **Begar or forced labour** without payment (historically imposed by landlords, moneylenders, wealthy persons)
- **Buying and selling of human beings** and using them as slaves
- **Bonded labour** (still continues in some forms, especially in brick kiln work - now declared a crime and punishable)
- **Child labour** in dangerous jobs like factories and mines (children below 14 years)

With child labour being made illegal and right to education becoming a fundamental right for children, this right against exploitation has become more meaningful.

### 4. Right to Freedom of Religion

According to our Constitution, everyone enjoys the right to follow the religion of their choice. This freedom is considered a hallmark of democracy.

#### Historical Context
Historically, rulers and emperors in different parts of the world did not allow residents to enjoy religious freedom. Persons following different religions were either persecuted or forced to convert to the official religion. Democracy has always incorporated freedom of religion as one of its basic principles.

#### Freedom of Faith and Worship
**Core Components:**
- Freedom to choose any religion
- Freedom to practice that religion
- **Freedom of conscience**: Person may choose any religion or choose not to follow any religion
- Freedom to **profess, follow and propagate** any religion

#### Limitations on Religious Freedom
Government can impose restrictions on religious freedom to protect:
- Public order
- Morality
- Health

**Examples of Government Intervention:**
The government has taken steps banning practices like:
- Sati
- Bigamy
- Human sacrifice

Such restrictions cannot be opposed as interference in right to freedom of religion.

#### Equality of All Religions
Being a country home to several religions, the government must extend equal treatment to different religions:

**Negative Aspect**: Government will not favour any particular religion
- India does not have any official religion
- No religious requirement for public offices (PM, President, Judge, etc.)
- No discrimination in government employment based on religion
- State institutions will not preach religion or give religious education

**Objective**: To sustain and nurture the principle of **secularism**

#### Controversies in Religious Freedom
- **Conversions**: Constitution guarantees right to propagate religion, including persuading people to convert, but some resent conversions based on intimidation or inducement
- **Forcible conversions**: Not allowed by Constitution
- **Right to spread information**: Only about one's religion to attract others

### 5. Cultural and Educational Rights

India is not a monolithic society but has vast diversity. In such diverse society, there are social sections which are small in numbers compared to other groups.

#### Philosophy Behind These Rights
Our Constitution believes that **diversity is our strength**. Therefore, one fundamental right is the right of minorities to maintain their culture.

#### Who Are Minorities?
**Minority status** is not dependent only upon religion:
- Religious minorities
- **Linguistic minorities**
- **Cultural minorities**

Minorities are groups that have common language or religion and are outnumbered by some other social section in a particular part of the country or country as a whole.

#### Rights of Minorities:
- Right to conserve and develop their own **culture, language, and script**
- Right to set up their own **educational institutions**
- **Non-discrimination** in government aid to educational institutions based on minority management

#### Constituent Assembly Perspective on Minority Rights

> "A heavy responsibility would be cast on the majority to see that in fact the minorities feel secure. …the only safety for the minorities lies in a secular State. It pays them to be nationalists ...The majority community should not boast of their national outlook. ...They should try to place themselves in the position of the minorities and try to appreciate their fears. All demands for safeguards ...are the products of those fears that the minorities have in their minds, ...as regards their language, their script and also about the services."
> 
> **- Sardar Hukam Singh, CAD, VIII, p. 322, 26 May 1949**

### 6. Right to Constitutional Remedies

Our Constitution contains an impressive list of Fundamental Rights, but merely writing them down is not enough. There must be a way to realise them in practice and defend them against attacks.

**Dr. Ambedkar** considered the right to constitutional remedies as **'heart and soul of the constitution'** because this right gives citizens the right to approach High Court or Supreme Court to get any fundamental rights restored in case of violation.

#### Powers of Courts
The Supreme Court and High Courts can:
- Issue orders and give directives to government for enforcement of rights
- Issue various special orders known as **writs**

#### Types of Writs:

**1. Habeas Corpus**
- Court orders that arrested person should be presented before it
- Can order to set free an arrested person if manner or grounds of arrest are not lawful or satisfactory

**2. Mandamus**
- Issued when court finds that a particular office holder is not doing legal duty and thereby infringing on individual's right

**3. Prohibition**
- Issued by higher court (High Court or Supreme Court) when lower court has considered a case going beyond its jurisdiction

**4. Quo Warranto**
- If court finds that a person is holding office but not entitled to hold that office, it restricts that person from acting as office holder

**5. Certiorari**
- Court orders a lower court or another authority to transfer a matter pending before it to the higher authority or court

#### Other Protective Mechanisms
Apart from judiciary, many other mechanisms have been created for rights protection:
- National Commission on Minorities
- National Commission on Women  
- National Commission on Scheduled Castes
- **National Human Rights Commission**

## National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)

The real test of rights given by any constitution is in their actual implementation. The poor, illiterate and deprived sections of society must be able to exercise their rights.

### Background
Independent organisations like People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) or People's Union for Democratic Rights (PUDR) have been working as watchdogs against violations of rights. Against this background, the government established the National Human Rights Commission in **1993**.

### Composition
The NHRC is composed of:
- Former chief justice of the Supreme Court of India
- Former judge of the Supreme Court
- Former chief justice of a High Court
- Two other members with knowledge and practical experience in human rights matters

### Functions
- **Inquiry** at its own initiative or on petition by victim into complaint of violation of human rights
- **Visit to jails** to study condition of inmates
- **Research** in the field of human rights
- **Promotion** of human rights awareness

### Work and Impact
- Receives complaints in thousands every year
- Cases relate to: custodial death, custodial rape, disappearances, police excesses, failure in taking action, indignity to women, etc.
- **Most significant interventions**: 
  - Disappeared youth in Punjab
  - Investigation and trial of Gujarat riot cases

### Limitations
- Does not have power of prosecution
- Can merely make recommendations to government
- Can recommend to courts to initiate proceedings based on inquiry

## Directive Principles of State Policy

### Background and Philosophy
The makers of our Constitution knew that independent India would face many challenges, foremost being the challenge to bring about equality and well-being of all citizens. They thought certain policy direction was required for handling these problems, but didn't want future governments to be bound by specific policy decisions.

### Nature of Directive Principles
- **Guidelines** incorporated in Constitution but **not legally enforceable**
- **Non-justiciable**: Parts of Constitution that cannot be enforced by judiciary
- If government doesn't implement a guideline, cannot go to court asking for implementation
- **Moral force** behind guidelines expected to ensure government takes them seriously
- People expected to hold governments responsible for implementing these directives

### Content of Directive Principles

The Directive Principles list mainly three things:

#### 1. Goals and Objectives Society Should Adopt:
- Welfare of the people
- Social, economic and political justice
- Raising the standard of living
- Equitable distribution of resources  
- Promotion of international peace

#### 2. Non-Justiciable Rights Individuals Should Enjoy:
- Adequate livelihood
- Equal pay for equal work for men and women
- Right against economic exploitation
- Right to work
- Early childhood care and education to children below six years

#### 3. Policies Government Should Adopt:
- Uniform civil code
- Prohibition of consumption of alcoholic liquor
- Promotion of cottage industries
- Prevention of slaughter of useful cattle
- Promotion of village panchayats

### Implementation of Directive Principles
Governments have tried to give effect to some Directive Principles:
- Zamindari abolition bills
- Nationalisation of banks
- Factory laws
- Fixed minimum wages
- Promotion of cottage and small industries
- Reservations for scheduled castes and tribes
- Right to education
- Formation of panchayati raj institutions

## Fundamental Duties of Citizens

### Introduction through 42nd Amendment
In **1976**, the **42nd amendment** to the Constitution was passed. Among other things, this amendment inserted a list of **Fundamental Duties of Citizens**. Ten duties were enumerated, but the Constitution does not say anything about enforcing these duties.

### Examples of Fundamental Duties
As citizens, we must:
- Abide by the Constitution
- Defend our country
- Promote harmony among all citizens
- Protect the environment

### Important Note
Our Constitution **does not make the enjoyment of rights dependent or conditional upon fulfilment of duties**. The inclusion of fundamental duties has not changed the status of our fundamental rights.

## Relationship Between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles

### Complementary Nature
It is possible to see both Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles as **complementary** to each other:
- **Fundamental Rights**: Restrain government from doing certain things
- **Directive Principles**: Exhort government to do certain things
- **Fundamental Rights**: Mainly protect rights of individuals  
- **Directive Principles**: Ensure well-being of entire society

### Areas of Conflict
Sometimes, when government intends to implement Directive Principles of State Policy, it can come in **conflict** with Fundamental Rights of citizens.

#### The Zamindari Abolition Case
This problem arose when government sought to pass laws to abolish zamindari system. These measures were opposed on the ground that they violated **right to property**. 

**Government's Position**: Rights can be abridged for giving effect to Directive Principles (assuming rights were hindrance to people's welfare)

**Court's Position**: Fundamental Rights were so important and sacred that they cannot be limited even for implementing Directive Principles

### The Right to Property Controversy

#### Original Status
Originally, the Constitution included a fundamental right to **'acquire, possess and maintain' property**, but made clear that property could be taken away by government for public welfare.

#### Evolution of the Debate
- Since 1950, government made many laws limiting this right to property
- Right to property was at centre of long debate over relationship between rights and directive principles
- In **1973**, Supreme Court decided that right to property was not part of basic structure of Constitution
- Parliament had power to abridge this right by amendment
- In **1978**, **44th amendment** removed right to property from list of Fundamental Rights
- Converted it into simple legal right under **Article 300 A**

### Constitutional Amendment Debate
This generated complicated debate about constitutional amendment:
- **Government's view**: Parliament can amend any part of Constitution
- **Court's view**: Parliament cannot make amendment that violates Fundamental Rights

### The Kesavananda Bharati Case Settlement
This controversy was settled by important Supreme Court decision in **Kesavananda Bharati case**:
- Court said there are certain **basic features** of Constitution
- These basic features **cannot be changed by Parliament**

## Conclusion

### Historical Development of Rights
In the writings of **Jotirao Phuley (1827-1890)**, a radical social reformer from Maharashtra, we find one of the earliest expressions of the view that rights include both **freedom and equality**. During the national movement, this idea of rights was further sharpened and expanded to constitutional rights.

### Constitutional Framework
Our Constitution reflected this long tradition and listed the fundamental rights. Since 1950, the **judiciary has functioned as an important protector of rights**.

### Expansion Through Judicial Interpretation
Judicial interpretations have **expanded the scope of rights** in many respects. The government and administration of our country function within this overall framework.

### Democratic Governance
**Rights enforce limitations** on the functioning of the government and ensure **democratic governance** of the country.

## Introduction: The Rules of Democratic Games

Have you ever played chess? What would happen if the black knight suddenly started moving straight rather than two and a half squares? Or, what would happen if in a game of cricket, there were no umpires? In any sport, we need to follow certain rules. Change the rules and the outcome of the game would be very different. Similarly a game needs an impartial umpire whose decision is accepted by all the players. The rules and the umpire have to be agreed upon before we begin to play a game.

What is true of a game is also true of elections. There are different rules or systems of conducting elections. The outcome of the election depends on the rules we have adopted. We need some machinery to conduct the elections in an impartial manner. Since these two decisions need to be taken before the game of electoral politics can begin, these cannot be left to any government. That is why these basic decisions about elections are written down in the constitution of a democratic country.

### Chapter Objectives

After reading this chapter, you would understand:
- Different methods of election
- The characteristics of the system of election adopted in our country
- The importance of the provisions for free and fair elections
- The debate on electoral reforms

## Elections and Democracy: Fundamental Questions

### Two Critical Questions About Democratic Representation

**Question 1: Can we have democracy without holding elections?**

**Question 2: Can we hold elections without having democracy?**

### The Necessity of Representation in Large Democracies

The first question reminds us of the necessity of representation in a large democracy. All citizens cannot take direct part in making every decision. Therefore, representatives are elected by the people. This is how elections become important. Whenever we think of India as a democracy, our mind invariably turns to the last elections. Elections have today become the most visible symbol of the democratic process.

#### Direct vs. Indirect Democracy

**Direct Democracy:**
- Citizens directly participate in day-to-day decision-making
- Citizens directly involved in running the government
- Examples: Ancient city-states in Greece, local governments (gram sabhas)
- Limitation: Cannot be practiced when decisions involve lakhs and crores of people

**Indirect Democracy (Representative Democracy):**
- Citizens choose representatives who govern and administer the country
- The method followed to choose representatives is called an election
- Citizens have limited role in major decisions and administration
- Citizens involved only indirectly through elected representatives
- The method of electing representatives becomes very important

### Non-Democratic Elections: A Warning

The second question reminds us that not all elections are democratic. A large number of non-democratic countries also hold elections. Non-democratic rulers are very keen to present themselves as democratic by holding elections in such a way that it does not threaten their rule.

**What distinguishes democratic from non-democratic elections?**

This is where constitution comes in. The constitution of a democratic country lays down some basic rules about elections:

1. **Who is eligible to vote?**
2. **Who is eligible to contest?**
3. **Who is to supervise elections?**
4. **How do the voters choose their representatives?**
5. **How are the votes to be counted and representatives elected?**

**Why write these rules in the Constitution?**
- Cannot be decided by Parliament alone
- Cannot be left to parties before every election
- Need constitutional permanence and protection

---

## Election Systems in India

### Understanding Different Electoral Methods

We have got so used to our system of elections that we think that there cannot be any other way. In a democratic election, people vote and their preference decides who will win the contest. But there can be very different ways in which people make their choices and very different ways in which their preferences can be counted. These different rules of the game can make a difference to who the winner will be.

### First Past the Post (FPTP) System

#### How FPTP Works in India

Under this system:
- The entire country is divided into 543 constituencies
- Each constituency elects one representative
- The candidate who secures the highest number of votes in that constituency is declared elected

**Key Features:**
- Winner need not secure a majority of votes
- Also called the Plurality System
- The candidate who crosses the winning post first is the winner
- Method prescribed by the Constitution

#### The 1984 Lok Sabha Election Example

**Congress Party Performance:**
- Won 415 of 543 Lok Sabha seats (more than 80% of seats)
- Received only 48% of total votes
- Achieved this with less than majority votes

**Other Parties' Performance:**

| Party | Votes (%) | Seats |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Congress | 48.0 | 415 |
| BJP | 7.4 | 2 |
| Janata | 6.7 | 10 |
| Lok Dal | 5.7 | 3 |
| CPI (M) | 5.7 | 22 |
| Telugu Desam | 4.1 | 30 |
| DMK | 2.3 | 2 |
| AIADMK | 1.6 | 12 |
| Akali Dal | 1.0 | 7 |
| AGP | 1.0 | 7 |

**How This Happens:**
- Congress candidates won in many constituencies with less than 50% votes
- Votes for losing candidates go "waste"
- A party could theoretically win all seats with only 25% votes if others get even less

### Proportional Representation (PR) System

#### How PR Works: The Israeli Model

**System Features:**
- Each party gets seats in parliament in proportion to its share of votes
- Entire country treated as one constituency
- Parties prepare preference lists before elections
- Voters vote for parties, not individual candidates
- Representatives from a constituency belong to different parties

#### PR System Variations

**Single National Constituency:**
- Examples: Israel, Netherlands
- Entire country as one constituency
- Seats allocated according to national vote share

**Multi-Member Constituencies:**
- Examples: Argentina, Portugal
- Country divided into several multi-member constituencies
- Each party prepares candidate lists for each constituency

#### Proportional Representation in Israel (2015 Election Results)

| Party | % of Total Votes | Number of Seats |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|
| Likud | 23.40 | 30 |
| Zionist Camp | 18.67 | 24 |
| Joint List | 10.61 | 13 |
| Yesh Atid | 8.82 | 11 |
| Kulanu | 7.49 | 10 |
| Habayit Hayehudi | 6.74 | 8 |
| Shas | 5.74 | 7 |
| Yisrael Beitenu | 5.10 | 6 |
| United Torah Judaism | 4.99 | 6 |
| Israel's Left | 3.93 | 5 |
| Other Parties | 4.51 | 0 |
| **Total** | **100** | **120** |

**Minimum Threshold:** Party must get minimum 3.25% votes to be eligible for seats.

### PR in Indian Context: Limited Usage

India has adopted PR system on limited scale for **indirect elections:**
- Election of President
- Election of Vice President
- Election to Rajya Sabha
- Election to Vidhan Parishads

#### Single Transferable Vote (STV) System for Rajya Sabha

**How STV Works:**
- MLAs are the voters
- Every voter ranks candidates according to preference
- Minimum quota formula for victory:

```
Total votes polled / (Total number of candidates to be elected + 1) + 1
```

**Example:** For 4 Rajya Sabha seats with 200 MLAs in Rajasthan:
- Required quota = (200/4+1) + 1 = 41 votes

**Counting Process:**
1. Count first preference votes
2. If required candidates don't meet quota, eliminate lowest vote getter
3. Transfer eliminated candidate's votes to second preferences
4. Continue until required number elected

### Comparison: FPTP vs PR Systems

| Aspect | FPTP | PR |
|--------|------|-----|
| **Constituency Structure** | Small geographical units | Large areas or entire country as constituency |
| **Representatives per Constituency** | One representative | More than one representative |
| **Voting Method** | Vote for candidate | Vote for party |
| **Seat Allocation** | Party may get more seats than vote percentage | Seats proportional to vote percentage |
| **Winner's Vote Share** | May not get majority (50%+1) | Gets majority of votes |
| **Examples** | U.K., India | Israel, Netherlands |

## Why India Adopted the FPTP System

### Reasons for Constitutional Choice

#### 1. Simplicity and Accessibility
- Extremely simple to understand for common voters
- No specialized political knowledge required
- Clear choice presented to voters
- Voters simply endorse a candidate or party

#### 2. Constituency-Based Representation
- Voters know their specific representative
- Representatives accountable to specific localities
- Choice between specific candidates, not just parties
- PR systems often use party lists without local representation

#### 3. Stable Government Formation
- Constitutional makers felt PR unsuitable for parliamentary system
- Parliamentary system requires executive majority in legislature
- PR may not produce clear majority (seats divided by vote share)
- FPTP gives largest party/coalition bonus seats
- Facilitates stable government formation

#### 4. Social Integration
- Encourages voters from different social groups to unite locally
- In diverse country like India, PR might encourage community-based national parties
- FPTP promotes cross-community coalition building

### Constitutional Experience Validation

The working of the Constitution has confirmed expectations:
- **Simplicity:** FPTP proved simple and familiar to ordinary voters
- **Stability:** Helped larger parties win clear majorities at center and state levels
- **Integration:** Discouraged parties getting votes only from one caste/community
- **Party System Evolution:** Though FPTP typically creates two-party systems, India developed unique patterns:
  - Post-independence: One party dominance with many smaller parties
  - Post-1989: Multi-party coalitions
  - Gradual emergence of two-party competition in many states
  - Coalition system allows new and smaller parties to compete despite FPTP

---

## Reservation of Constituencies

### The Problem: Social Group Representation

In the FPTP system, candidates securing highest votes win. This often disadvantages smaller social groups, particularly significant in Indian social context given history of caste-based discrimination. The FPTP system could mean dominant social groups win everywhere while oppressed groups remain unrepresented.

### Historical Context: Separate Electorates vs Reserved Constituencies

#### British-Era Separate Electorates
- System where only community members could vote for their community's representative
- Constituent Assembly members feared this wouldn't suit Indian purposes

> **Tajamul Husain's Opposition (CAD, Vol. VIII, p. 333, 26 May 1949):**
> "Separate electorates have been a curse to India, have done incalculable harm to this country… Separate electorates have barred our progress… We (Muslims) want to merge in the nation. ...for God's sake keep your hands off reservation for the Muslim community."

#### Constitutional Solution: Reserved Constituencies
- All voters in constituency eligible to vote
- Candidates must belong to specific community/social section for which seat is reserved
- Ensures representation while maintaining unified electorate

### Constitutional Provisions for Reservation

#### Current Reservation Structure
- **Lok Sabha:** 84 seats reserved for Scheduled Castes, 47 for Scheduled Tribes (out of 543 elected seats, as on 26 January 2019)
- **State Legislative Assemblies:** Proportional reservation based on population
- **Duration:** Initially for 10 years, extended through successive amendments until 2020
- **Extension:** Parliament can decide further extensions

#### Delimitation Commission's Role

**Composition and Appointment:**
- Independent body appointed by President of India
- Works in collaboration with Election Commission of India
- Purpose: Drawing constituency boundaries across the country

**Reservation Decision Process:**
1. **State Quota:** Fixed based on SC/ST proportion in state population
2. **ST Constituencies:** Those with highest proportion of ST population
3. **SC Constituencies:** 
   - Higher proportion of SC population
   - Spread across different regions of state (SC population generally evenly distributed)
4. **Rotation:** Reserved constituencies can be rotated during each delimitation exercise

> **Jaipal Singh on Adivasi Representation (CAD, Vol. V, pp. 209-210, 27 August 1947):**
> "…But I have come to say a few words on behalf of the Adivasis of India…. In the past, thanks to the major political parties, thanks to the British Government and thanks to every enlightened Indian citizen, we have been isolated and kept, as it were, in a zoo. ...We are willing to mix with you, and it is for that reason, ..., that we have insisted on a reservation of seats as far as the Legislatures are concerned. We have not asked ...(for) separate electorates; ...Under the 1935 Act, throughout the Legislatures in India, there were altogether only 24 Adivasi MLAs out of a total of 1585, …and not a single representative at the Centre."

### Other Groups and Representation Issues

#### Women's Representation
- **Current Status:** Very few women elected to representative bodies
- **Proposed Solution:** Reserve one-third seats for women in Parliament and Assemblies
- **Existing Provision:** Reservation in rural and urban local bodies
- **Constitutional Requirement:** Amendment needed for Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabhas
- **Status:** Proposed several times but not yet passed

#### Muslim Representation Case Study
- **Population Share:** About 14.2% of India's population
- **Lok Sabha Representation:** Usually less than 6% MPs (less than half of population share)
- **Similar Pattern:** Prevails in most State Assemblies

**Student Perspectives on Muslim Representation:**

**Hilal's View:** "This demonstrates the unfairness of the FPTP system. We should have opted for PR system."

**Arif's View:** "This shows the wisdom of granting reservations to SC and ST. What is needed is a reservation of seats for Muslims on the same lines as for SC and ST."

**Saba's View:** "There is no point in talking about Muslims as a whole. Muslim women are not going to get any share in any of these systems. We need a separate quota for Muslim women."

1. **Militancy-Affected Areas:** Elections in Assam, Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir
2. **1991 Crisis:** Postponed elections after PM Rajiv Gandhi's assassination during campaigning
3. **2002 Gujarat Crisis:** 
   - Assembly dissolved, elections required
   - Unprecedented violence made free and fair elections impossible
   - Commission postponed elections by few months
   - Supreme Court upheld this decision

**Institutional Evolution:** Election Commission more independent and assertive now than 25 years ago - not due to increased powers, but more effective use of existing constitutional powers.

## Electoral Reforms: Contemporary Debates

### Current System Limitations

No election system can ever be perfect. The experience of past 66 years has generated many reform suggestions from Election Commission, political parties, independent groups, and scholars.

### Major Reform Proposals

#### 1. Electoral System Changes
**Proposal:** Change from FPTP to variant of PR system
**Rationale:** Ensure parties get seats proportional to votes received

#### 2. Gender Representation
**Proposal:** Special provision ensuring at least one-third women elected to Parliament and Assemblies
**Current Status:** Reservation exists in rural and urban local bodies
**Requirement:** Constitutional amendment needed for Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabhas

#### 3. Money in Politics
**Proposal:** 
- Stricter provisions controlling money's role in electoral politics
- Government payment of election expenses from special fund

#### 4. Criminal Cases and Candidature
**Proposal:** Bar candidates with any criminal case, even if appeal pending

**Challenge:** Enforcement and definition difficulties

#### 6. Political Party Regulation
**Proposal:** Law regulating political party functioning
**Objective:** Ensure transparent and democratic internal party operations

### Limitations of Legal Reforms

**Beyond Constitutional Changes:** Free and fair elections require candidates, parties, and election participants to abide by democratic competition spirit.

**Additional Requirements:**
1. **Citizen Vigilance:** People must be more actively involved in political activities
2. **Institutional Watchdogs:** Political institutions and voluntary organizations must function as election monitors
3. **Democratic Culture:** Legal reforms alone insufficient without democratic values

---

# Chapter 4: Executive
## Indian Constitution at Work

---

## Introduction: The Three Pillars of Government

Legislature, executive and judiciary are the three organs of government. Together, they perform the functions of the government, maintain law and order and look after the welfare of the people. The Constitution ensures that they work in coordination with each other and maintain a balance among themselves. In a parliamentary system, executive and the legislature are interdependent: the legislature controls the executive, and, in turn, is controlled by the executive.

### Learning Objectives
After reading this chapter, you will be able to:
- Make a distinction between the parliamentary and the presidential executive
- Understand the constitutional position of the President of India
- Know the composition and functioning of the Council of Ministers and the importance of the Prime Minister
- Understand the importance and functioning of the administrative machinery

---

## What is an Executive?

### Understanding Executive Functions

Who is in charge of the administration of your school? Who takes important decisions in a school or a university? In any organisation, some office holder has to take decisions and implement those decisions. We call this activity administration or management. But administration requires a body at the top that will take policy decisions or the big decisions and supervise and coordinate the routine administrative functioning.

You may have heard about the executives of big companies, banks or industrial units. Every formal group has a body of those who function as the chief administrators or the executives of that organisation. Some office holders decide the policies and rules and regulations and then some office holders implement those decisions in actual day-to-day functioning of the organisation. **The word executive means a body of persons that looks after the implementation of rules and regulations in actual practice.**

### Executive in Government Context

In the case of government also, one body may take policy decisions and decide about rules and regulations, while the other one would be in charge of implementing those rules. **The organ of government that primarily looks after the function of implementation and administration is called the executive.**

### Principal Functions of the Executive

Executive is the branch of government responsible for the implementation of laws and policies adopted by the legislature. The executive is often involved in framing of policy. The official designations of the executive vary from country to country. Some countries have presidents, while others have chancellors.

### Types of Executive Personnel

The executive branch is not just about presidents, prime ministers and ministers. It also extends to the administrative machinery (civil servants).

- **Political Executive**: The heads of government and their ministers, saddled with the overall responsibility of government policy
- **Permanent Executive**: Those responsible for day to day administration (civil servants)

> **Student Question**: "I remember somebody saying that the executive in a democracy is accountable to people. Is that also true of executives in big companies? Aren't they called CEOs? Who are they accountable to?"

---

## Different Types of Executive Systems

Every country may not have the same type of executive. You may have heard about the President of the USA and the Queen of England. But the powers and functions of the President of the USA are very different from the powers of the President of India. Similarly, the powers of the Queen of England are different from the powers of the King of Bhutan. Both India and France have prime ministers, but their roles are different from each other. Why is this so?

### Global Executive Systems Overview

**United States**: Presidential system with executive powers in the hands of the president

**Canada**: Parliamentary democracy with constitutional monarchy where Queen Elizabeth II is the formal chief of state and the prime minister is the head of government

**France**: Semi-presidential system where both the president and the prime minister are part of the executive. The president appoints the prime minister as well as the ministers but cannot dismiss them as they are responsible to the parliament

**Japan**: Parliamentary system with the Emperor as the head of the state and the prime minister as the head of government

**Italy**: Parliamentary system with the president as the formal head of state and the prime minister as the head of government

**Russia**: Semi-presidential system where president is the head of state and prime minister, who is appointed by the president, is the head of government

**Germany**: Parliamentary system in which president is the ceremonial head of state and the chancellor is the head of government

### Three Main Types of Executive Systems

#### 1. Presidential System
- The president is the Head of state as well as head of government
- The office of president is very powerful, both in theory and practice
- Countries: United States, Brazil and most nations in Latin America

#### 2. Parliamentary System
- The prime minister is the head of government
- Most parliamentary systems have a president or a monarch who is the nominal Head of state
- The role of president or monarch is primarily ceremonial and prime minister along with the cabinet wields effective power
- Countries: Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, Portugal

#### 3. Semi-Presidential System
- Has both a president and a prime minister
- Unlike the parliamentary system, the president may possess significant day-to-day powers
- Sometimes the president and the prime minister may belong to the same party and at times they may belong to two different parties
- Countries: France, Russia, Sri Lanka

### Case Study: Semi-Presidential Executive in Sri Lanka

In 1978 the constitution of Sri Lanka was amended and the system of Executive Presidency was introduced. Under the system of Executive Presidency, people directly elect the President. It may happen that both the President and the Prime Minister belong to the same political party or to different political parties.

#### Powers of the Sri Lankan President
- Chooses the Prime Minister from the party that has a majority in the Parliament
- Has the power to remove the Prime Minister or ministers
- Serves as elected Head of State and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces
- Also serves as Head of the Government
- Elected for a term of six years
- Cannot be removed except by a resolution in parliament passed by at least two-thirds of the total number of Members of Parliament

#### Impeachment Process in Sri Lanka
If a resolution is passed by not less than one-half of the total number of Members of Parliament and the Speaker is satisfied that such allegations merit inquiry, then the Speaker can report the matter to the Supreme Court.

> **Study Question**: How is the position of the President and Prime Minister in Sri Lanka different from India? Compare the role of Supreme Court in the impeachment of the President in India and Sri Lanka.

## Parliamentary Executive in India

### Historical Foundation

When the Constitution of India was written, India already had some experience of running the parliamentary system under the Acts of 1919 and 1935. This experience had shown that in the parliamentary system, the executive can be effectively controlled by the representatives of the people. The makers of the Indian Constitution wanted to ensure that the government would be sensitive to public expectations and would be responsible and accountable.

### Why Parliamentary System Over Presidential?

The other alternative to the parliamentary executive was the presidential form of government. But the presidential executive puts much emphasis on the president as the chief executive and as source of all executive power. There is always the danger of personality cult in presidential executive. The makers of the Indian Constitution wanted a government that would have a strong executive branch, but at the same time, enough safeguards should be there to check against the personality cult.

In the parliamentary form there are many mechanisms that ensure that the executive will be answerable to and controlled by the legislature or people's representatives. So the Constitution adopted the parliamentary system of executive for the governments both at the national and State levels.

> **Student Reflection**: "Haven't we had very strong Prime Ministers? Does it mean that even the parliamentary system is not fool proof against personality cult? That means people and the legislatures have to be constantly vigilant!"

### Structure of Indian Executive

#### National Level
- **Formal Head**: President (Head of State)
- **Real Executive**: Prime Minister and Council of Ministers

#### State Level
- **Formal Head**: Governor
- **Real Executive**: Chief Minister and Council of Ministers

> **Common Misconception**: 
> Neha: "It is really very simple. A country having a president has a presidential executive and one with a prime minister has parliamentary executive."
> 
> **Correction**: This is not always the case - many countries have both presidents and prime ministers with different power distributions.

## The President of India

### Constitutional Position and Powers

The Constitution of India vests the executive power of the Union formally in the President. In reality, the President exercises these powers through the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister.

### Election and Term
- The President is elected for a period of five years
- No direct election by the people for the office of President
- The President is elected indirectly by elected MLAs and MPs
- Election follows the principle of proportional representation with single transferable vote

### Removal Process
The President can be removed from office only by Parliament by following the procedure for impeachment. This procedure requires a special majority. The only ground for impeachment is violation of the Constitution.

### Constitutional Framework for Presidential Powers

#### Article 74 (1):
> "There shall be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head to aid and advise the President who shall in the exercise of his functions, act in accordance with such advice.
> 
> Provided that the President may require the Council of Ministers to reconsider such advice….., and the President shall act in accordance with the advice tendered after such reconsideration."

**Key Point**: The word "shall" indicates that the advice is binding on the President. In view of the controversy about the scope of the President's powers, a specific mention was made in the Constitution by an amendment that the advice of the Council of Ministers will be binding on the President. By another amendment made later, it was decided that the President can ask the Council of Ministers to reconsider its advice but, has to accept the reconsidered advice of the Council of Ministers.

### Presidential Powers and Role

The President is the formal head of the government. In this formal sense, the President has wide ranging executive, legislative, judicial and emergency powers. In a parliamentary system, these powers are in reality used by the President only on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers have support of the majority in the Lok Sabha and they are the real executive. In most of the cases, the President has to follow the advice of the Council of Ministers.

#### Nehru's Vision of the Presidency
> "We did not give him any real power but we have made his position one of authority and dignity. The constitution wants to create neither a real executive nor a mere figurehead, but a head that neither reigns nor governs; it wants to create a great figurehead..." - Jawaharlal Nehru (CAD, Vol. VI, p. 734)

> **Textbook Character Question**: "Am I just a figurehead or am I asking real questions? Did the textbook writers give me power to ask questions I wish to ask or am I asking questions they have in their mind?"

### Discretionary Powers of the President

On the basis of the above discussion can we infer that the President has no discretionary power under any circumstances? This will be an incorrect assessment. Constitutionally, the President has a right to be informed of all important matters and deliberations of the Council of Ministers. The Prime Minister is obliged to furnish all the information that the President may call for. The President often writes to the Prime Minister and expresses his views on matters confronting the country.

#### Three Situations for Presidential Discretion

##### 1. Power to Send Back Advice for Reconsideration
The President can send back the advice given by the Council of Ministers and ask the Council to reconsider the decision. When the President thinks that the advice has certain flaws or legal lacunae, or that it is not in the best interests of the country, the President can ask the Council to reconsider the decision. Although, the Council can still send back the same advice and the President would then be bound by that advice, such a request by the President to reconsider the decision, would naturally carry a lot of weight.

##### 2. Veto Power
The President has veto power by which he can withhold or refuse to give assent to Bills (other than Money Bill) passed by the Parliament. Every bill passed by the Parliament goes to the President for his assent before it becomes a law. The President can send the bill back to the Parliament asking it to reconsider the bill. This 'veto' power is limited because, if the Parliament passes the same bill again and sends it back to the President, then, the President has to give assent to that bill.

###### Pocket Veto
There is no mention in the Constitution about the time limit within which the President must send the bill back for reconsideration. This means that the President can just keep the bill pending with him without any time limit. This gives the President an informal power to use the veto in a very effective manner. This is sometimes referred to as 'pocket veto'.

**Historical Example**: In 1986, the Parliament passed a bill known as Indian Post office (amendment) bill. This bill was widely criticised by many for it sought to curtail the freedom of the press. The then President, Gyani Zail Singh, did not take any decision on this bill. After his term was over, the next President, Venkataraman sent the bill finally back to the Parliament for reconsideration. By that time, the government that brought the bill before the Parliament had changed and a new government was elected in 1989. This government belonged to a different coalition and did not bring the bill back before the Parliament. Thus, Zail Singh's decision to postpone giving assent to the bill effectively meant that the bill could never become a law!

##### 3. Appointment of Prime Minister in Hung Parliament
Formally, the President appoints the Prime Minister. Normally, in the parliamentary system, a leader who has the support of the majority in the Lok Sabha would be appointed as Prime Minister and the question of discretion would not arise. But imagine a situation when after an election, no leader has a clear majority in the Lok Sabha. Imagine further that after attempts to forge alliances, two or three leaders are claiming that they have the support of the majority in the house. Now, the President has to decide whom to appoint as the Prime Minister. In such a situation, the President has to use his own discretion in judging who really may have the support of the majority or who can actually form and run the government.

#### Historical Context: Increased Presidential Role (1989-1998)

Since 1989 major political changes have considerably increased the importance of the presidential office. In the four parliamentary elections held from 1989 to 1998, no single party or coalition attained a majority in the Lok Sabha. These situations demanded presidential intervention either in order to constitute governments or to grant a request for dissolution of Lok Sabha by a Prime Minister who could not prove majority in the House.

**Case Study - President's Role in 1998**: No political party or coalition secured majority in the elections held in March 1998. The BJP and its allies secured 251 seats, 21 short of a majority. President Narayanan adopted an elaborate procedure. He asked the leader of the alliance, Atal Behari Vajpayee, "to furnish documents in support of his claim from concerned political parties." Not stopping at this the President also advised Vajpayee to secure a vote of confidence within ten days of being sworn in.

### Presidential Discretion and Political Conditions

Presidential discretion is related to political conditions. There is greater scope for presidential assertiveness when governments are not stable and coalitions occupy power.

### Why Do We Need a President?

For the most part, the President is a formal power holder and a ceremonial head of the nation. You may wonder why then do we need a President? In a parliamentary system, the Council of Ministers is dependent on the support of the majority in the legislature. This also means that the Council of Ministers may be removed at any time and a new Council of Ministers will have to be put in place. Such a situation requires a Head of the state who has a fixed term, who may be empowered to appoint the Prime Minister and who may symbolically represent the entire country. This is exactly the role of the President in ordinary circumstances. Besides, when no party has a clear majority, the President has the additional responsibility of making a choice and appointing the Prime Minister to run the government of the country.

### The Vice President of India

#### Election and Term
- The Vice President is elected for five years
- Election method is similar to that of the President
- The only difference is that members of State legislatures are not part of the electoral college

#### Functions and Powers
- Acts as the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha
- Takes over the office of the President when there is a vacancy by reasons of death, resignation, removal by impeachment or otherwise
- Acts as the President only until a new President is elected

#### Removal Process
The Vice President may be removed from his office by a resolution of the Rajya Sabha passed by a majority and agreed to by the Lok Sabha.

**Historical Example**: B. D. Jatti acted as President on the death of Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed until a new President was elected.

> **Gender Question**: "It is very well to talk of the President as He or She, but has a woman ever become the President?"

## Prime Minister and Council of Ministers

### The Central Role of the Prime Minister

No discussion of government or politics in India, would normally take place without mentioning one office: the Prime Minister of India. Can you imagine why this is so?

We have already seen earlier in this chapter that the President exercises his powers only on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers is headed by the Prime Minister. Therefore, as head of the Council of Ministers, the Prime Minister becomes the most important functionary of the government in our country.

### Constitutional Requirements for Prime Minister

In the parliamentary form of executive, it is essential that the Prime Minister has the support of the majority in the Lok Sabha. This support by the majority also makes the Prime Minister very powerful. The moment this support of the majority is lost, the Prime Minister loses the office.

#### Historical Evolution
- For many years after independence, the Congress party had the majority in the Lok Sabha and its leader would become the Prime Minister
- Since 1989, there have been many occasions when no party had majority in the Lok Sabha
- Various political parties have come together and formed a coalition that has majority in the House
- In such situations, a leader who is acceptable to most partners of the coalition becomes the Prime Minister

### Appointment and Composition Process

Formally, a leader who has the support of the majority is appointed by the President as Prime Minister. The Prime Minister then decides who will be the ministers in the Council of Ministers. The Prime Minister allocates ranks and portfolios to the ministers.

#### Ministerial Ranks
Depending upon the seniority and political importance, the ministers are given the ranks of:
- Cabinet minister
- Minister of State
- Deputy minister

#### Constitutional Requirements
- The Prime Minister and all the ministers have to be members of the Parliament
- If someone becomes a minister or Prime Minister without being an MP, such a person has to get elected to the Parliament within six months
- In the same manner, Chief Ministers of the States choose ministers from their own party or coalition

### Alternative Perspective from Constituent Assembly

There were some members in the Constituent Assembly who felt that ministers should be elected by the legislature and not selected by the Prime Minister or Chief Minister:

> "Swiss system under which the legislature elects the executive for a certain period …is to my mind the best form of government for the provinces… The system of the single transferable vote is ...the best system that can be adopted for the appointment of the executive because in that all interests will be represented and no party in the legislature will have any occasion to feel that it is not represented." - Begum Aizaz Rasul, CAD, Vol. IV, p. 631, 17 July 1947

### Size of the Council of Ministers

#### Before 91st Amendment Act (2003)
The size of the Council of Ministers was determined according to exigencies of time and requirements of the situation. But this led to very large size of the Council of Ministers. Besides, when no party had a clear majority, there was a temptation to win over the support of the members of the Parliament by giving them ministerial positions as there was no restriction on the number of the members of the Council of Ministers. This was happening in many States also.

#### After 91st Amendment Act (2003)
An amendment was made that the Council of Ministers shall not exceed 15 percent of total number of members of the House of the People (or Assembly, in the case of the States).

### Collective Responsibility

The most important feature of parliamentary executive is that the executive is routinely under the control and supervision of the legislature. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.

#### Principles of Collective Responsibility
- A Ministry which loses confidence of the Lok Sabha is obliged to resign
- The ministry is an executive committee of the Parliament and it collectively governs on behalf of the Parliament
- Based on the principle of the solidarity of the cabinet
- A vote of no confidence even against a single minister leads to the resignation of the entire Council of Ministers
- If a minister does not agree with a policy or decision of the cabinet, he or she must either accept the decision or resign
- Binding on all ministers to pursue or agree to a policy for which there is collective responsibility

### The Prime Minister's Pre-eminent Position

#### Constitutional Significance
In India, the Prime Minister enjoys a pre-eminent place in the government. The Council of Ministers cannot exist without the Prime Minister. The Council comes into existence only after the Prime Minister has taken the oath of office. The death or resignation of the Prime Minister automatically brings about the dissolution of the Council of Ministers but the demise, dismissal or resignation of a minister only creates a ministerial vacancy.

#### Role as Linchpin
The Prime Minister acts as a link between the Council of Ministers on the one hand and the President as well as the Parliament on the other. It is this role of the Prime Minister which led Pt. Nehru to describe him as 'the linchpin of Government'.

#### Constitutional Obligations
It is the constitutional obligation of the Prime Minister to communicate to the President all decisions of the Council of Ministers relating to the administration of the affairs of the Union and proposals for legislation. The Prime Minister is involved in all crucial decisions of the government and decides on the policies of the government.

### Sources of Prime Ministerial Power

The power wielded by the Prime Minister flows from various sources:
- Control over the Council of Ministers
- Leadership of the Lok Sabha
- Command over the bureaucratic machine
- Access to media
- Projection of personalities during elections
- Projection as national leader during international summitry as well as foreign visits

> **Philosophical Question**: "Is it that a person becomes Prime Minister because he/she is powerful or is it that you become powerful once you have become the Prime Minister?"

### Impact of Coalition Politics on Prime Ministerial Power

The power which the Prime Minister wields and actually puts into use depends upon the prevailing political conditions. The position of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers has been unassailable whenever a single political party has secured majority in the Lok Sabha. However, this has not been the case when governments have been led by coalitions of political parties.

#### Changes Since 1989
Since 1989, we have witnessed many coalition governments in India. Many of these governments could not remain in power for the full term of the Lok Sabha. They were either removed or they resigned due to loss of support of the majority.

#### Four Major Impacts on Parliamentary Executive

##### 1. Growing Discretionary Role of President
These developments have resulted in a growing discretionary role of the President in the selection of Prime Ministers.

##### 2. Erosion of Prime Ministerial Authority
The coalitional nature of Indian politics in this period has necessitated much more consultation between political partners, leading to erosion of prime ministerial authority.

##### 3. Restrictions on Prime Ministerial Prerogatives
It has also brought restrictions on various prerogatives of the Prime Minister like choosing the ministers and deciding their ranks and portfolios.

##### 4. Collective Policy Making
Even the policies and programmes of the government cannot be decided by the Prime Minister alone. Political parties of different ideologies come together both as pre-poll and post-poll allies to form a government. Policies are framed after a lot of negotiations and compromises among the allies. In this entire process, the Prime Minister has to act more as a negotiator than as leader of the government.

### State Level Executive

At the State level, a similar parliamentary executive exists, though with some variations. The most important variation is that there is a Governor of the State appointed by the President (on the advice of the central government). Though the Chief Minister, like the Prime Minister is the leader of the majority party in the Assembly, the Governor has more discretionary powers. However, the main principles of parliamentary system operate at the State level too.

### Study Exercise: Presidential Decision-Making

**Scenario**: Imagine that the Prime Minister wants to impose 'President's rule' in one State because the State government has failed to effectively curb atrocities against the Dalits in that State. The President has a different position. He is saying that the provision regarding President's rule should be used only sparingly. In this situation which of the following courses are open to the President?

a. Tell the Prime Minister that he will not sign on the order promulgating President's rule
b. Dismiss the Prime Minister
c. Ask the Prime Minister to send CRPF to that State
d. Make a press statement about how the Prime Minister is wrong
e. Discuss the matter with the Prime Minister and try to dissuade him from taking this action, but if he insists, agreeing to sign the said order

### Study Exercise: Prime Ministerial Selection

Suppose the Prime Minister is to select the Council of Ministers. What will he/she do?

a. Select those who are experts in the various subjects
b. Select only those who are from his/her party
c. Select those who are personally loyal and dependable
d. Select those who are supporters of the government
e. Take into account the political weight of the various aspirants and choose from among them

## Permanent Executive: Bureaucracy

### Who Implements Ministerial Decisions?

The Executive organ of the government includes the Prime Minister, the ministers and a large organisation called the bureaucracy or the administrative machinery. To underline the difference between this machinery and the military service, it is described as civil service. Trained and skilled officers who work as permanent employees of the government are assigned the task of assisting the ministers in formulating policies and implementing these policies.

### Democratic Control of Bureaucracy

In a democracy, the elected representatives and the ministers are in charge of government and the administration is under their control and supervision. In the parliamentary system, the legislature also exercises control over the administration. The administrative officers cannot act in violation of the policies adopted by the legislature. It is the responsibility of the ministers to retain political control over the administration.

### Professional and Political Neutrality

India has established professional administrative machinery. At the same time, this machinery is made politically accountable. The bureaucracy is also expected to be politically neutral. This means that the bureaucracy will not take any political position on policy matters.

#### Continuity Across Governments
In a democracy, it is always possible that a party is defeated in elections and the new government wants to opt for new policies in the place of policies of the previous government. In such a situation, it is the responsibility of the administrative machinery to faithfully and efficiently participate in drafting the policy and in its implementation.

### Structure of Indian Bureaucracy

The Indian bureaucracy today is an enormously complex system. It consists of:
- The All-India services
- State services
- Employees of the local governments
- Technical and managerial staff running public sector undertakings

### Constitutional Framework for Civil Services

#### Merit-Based Selection
Makers of our Constitution were aware of the importance of the non-partisan and professional bureaucracy. They also wanted the members of the civil services or bureaucracy to be impartially selected on the basis of merit. So, the Union Public Service Commission has been entrusted with the task of conducting the process of recruitment of the civil servants for the government of India. Similar public service commissions are provided for the States also.

#### Protection of Public Service Commissions
Members of the Public Service Commissions are appointed for a fixed term. Their removal or suspension is subject to a thorough enquiry made by a judge of the Supreme Court.

### Social Representation in Bureaucracy

While efficiency and merit are the norms for recruitment, the Constitution also ensures that all sections of the society including the weaker sections have an opportunity to be part of the public bureaucracy.

#### Reservation Provisions
- The Constitution has provided for reservation of jobs for the Dalits and Adivasis
- Subsequently, reservations have also been provided for women and other backward classes
- These provisions ensure that the bureaucracy would be more representative and social inequalities will not come in the way of recruitment to the civil service

### All-India Services and Federal Structure

#### IAS and IPS Officers
Persons selected by the UPSC for Indian Administrative Service and Indian Police Service constitute the backbone of the higher level bureaucracy in the States. The collector of a district is the most important officer of the government at the district level. The collector is normally an IAS officer and that the officer is governed by the service conditions laid down by the central government.

#### Central Control Over State Administration
An IAS or IPS officer is assigned to a particular State, where he or she works under the supervision of the State government. However:
- IAS or IPS officers are appointed by the central government
- They can go back into the service of the central government
- Most importantly, only the central government can take disciplinary action against them

This means that the key administrative officers of the States are under the supervision and control of the central government. Apart from the IAS and the IPS officers appointed by the UPSC, the administration of the State is looked after by officers appointed through the State Public Service Commissions. This feature of the bureaucracy strengthens the control of the central government over the administration of the States.

### Challenges in Bureaucratic Functioning

#### Public Perception and Access
The bureaucracy is an instrument through which welfare policies of the government must reach the people. But most often, it is so powerful that people are afraid of approaching a government officer. It is a common experience of the people that bureaucracy is insensitive to the demands and expectations of the ordinary citizen.

> **Public Sentiment**: "Yes, I know that the officers are there to serve the people. But people are always afraid of these officers. And officers also behave as if they were the masters!"

#### Balance Between Political Control and Independence
Only if the democratically elected government controls the bureaucracy, some of these problems can be effectively handled. On the other hand, too much political interference turns the bureaucracy into an instrument in the hands of the politician. Though the Constitution has created independent machinery for recruitment, many people think that there is no provision for protecting the civil servants from political interference in the performance of their duties.

#### Accountability Concerns
It is also felt that enough provisions are not there to ensure the accountability of the bureaucracy to the citizen. There is an expectation that measures like the Right to Information may make the bureaucracy a little more responsive and accountable.

## Conclusion: Democratic Control of Executive Power

The modern executive is a very powerful institution of government. The executive enjoys greater powers compared to other organs of the government. This generates a greater need to have democratic control over the executive. The makers of our Constitution thought with foresight that the executive must be put firmly under regular supervision and control. Thus, a parliamentary executive was chosen. Periodic elections, constitutional limits over the exercise of powers and democratic politics have ensured that executive organ cannot become unresponsive.

## Visual Learning Elements

### Political Cartoons and Their Messages

#### Cartoon 1: Prime Minister Leading Council of Ministers
*Shankar, Copyright: Children's Book Trust, 22 August 1954*

"There is no Council of Ministers without the Prime Minister. This cartoon shows how, literally, the Prime Minister 'leads' the Council of Ministers!"

#### Cartoon 2: Ministerial Aspirations
*R K Laxman in The Times of India*

"Why do people want to be ministers? This cartoon seems to suggest that it is only for perks and status! Then why is there competition for some portfolios?"

#### Cartoon 3: Confidence Motion Paradox
*R K Laxman in The Times of India*

"This Chief Minister is not happy even after winning the confidence motion! Can you imagine why this is so?"

# Chapter Five: LEGISLATURE
*Indian Constitution at Work*

## INTRODUCTION

You have already studied the importance of elections and the method of election adopted in India. Legislatures are elected by the people and work on behalf of the people. In this chapter you would study how elected legislatures function and help in maintaining democratic government. You will also learn about the composition and functioning of the parliament and State legislatures in India and their importance in democratic government. 

### Learning Objectives
After reading this chapter you would know:
- The importance of the legislature
- The functions and powers of the Parliament of India
- The law making procedure
- How the Parliament controls the executive
- How the Parliament regulates itself

---

## WHY DO WE NEED A PARLIAMENT?

### The Democratic Heart of Government

Legislature is not merely a law making body. Lawmaking is but one of the functions of the legislature. **It is the centre of all democratic political process.** It is packed with action; walkouts, protests, demonstration, unanimity, concern and co-operation. All these serve very vital purposes. Indeed, a genuine democracy is inconceivable without a representative, efficient and effective legislature. 

The legislature also helps people in holding the representatives accountable. This is indeed, the very basis of representative democracy.

### Contemporary Challenges to Parliamentary Supremacy

Yet, in most democracies, legislatures are losing central place to the executive. In India too, the Cabinet initiates policies, sets the agenda for governance and carries them through. This has led some critics to remark that the Parliament has declined. 

However, even very strong cabinets must retain majority in the legislature. A strong leader has to face the Parliament and answer to the satisfaction of the Parliament. **Herein lies the democratic potential of the Parliament.** It is recognised as one of the most democratic and open forum of debate. On account of its composition, it is the most representative of all organs of government. It is above all, vested with the power to choose and dismiss the government.

### Activity: Understanding Legislative Control
Consider these newspaper reports and then think: **what would happen if there were no legislatures?** After reading each news report, state how the legislature succeeded or failed in maintaining control over the executive.

**Case Study 1: Fertilizer Price Control (2002)**
- **28th February 2002**: The Union Finance Minister, Jaswant Singh, announced in the Union budget proposal an increase of Rs. 12 in the price of a 50 kg bag of urea and a smaller increase in the price of two other fertilizers which constituted about 5 per cent rise in prices. The current urea price of Rs. 4,830 a tonne carries a subsidy of as much as 80 per cent.

- **11 March 2002**: The Finance Minister had to roll back the increases in fertilizer prices under intense opposition pressure (*The Hindu*, 12 March 2002)

**Case Study 2: Urea Price Protests (1998)**
- **On 4 June 1998**: The Lok Sabha witnessed acrimonious scenes over the hike in urea and petroleum prices. The entire opposition staged a walkout. The issue rocked the house for two days leading to walkout by opposition. The finance minister in his budget proposal had proposed a hike of 50 paisa per kilogram of urea to reduce subsidy on it. This forced the finance minister Mr. Yashwant Sinha to roll back the hike in urea prices (*Hindustan Times*, 4 and 5 June 1998)

**Case Study 3: Assam Crisis (1983)**
- **22 February 1983**: In a rare move, the Lok Sabha today unanimously decided to suspend official business and give precedence to debate on Assam. Home Minister P.C.Sethi made a statement "I seek the cooperation of all members whatever their views and policies, in promoting harmony among different communities and groups living in Assam. What is needed now is not acrimony but a healing touch." (*Hindustan Times*, 22 February 1983)

**Case Study 4: Social Justice Issues (1985)**
- Congress Members voiced protest against atrocities on Harijans in Andhra Pradesh (*The Hindu*, 3 March 1985)

---

## WHY DO WE NEED TWO HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT?

### Understanding Parliamentary Structure

The term **'Parliament'** refers to the national legislature. The legislature of the States is described as State legislature. The Parliament in India has two houses. When there are two houses of the legislature, it is called a **bicameral legislature**. 

The two Houses of the Indian Parliament are:
1. **Council of States** or the **Rajya Sabha**
2. **House of the People** or the **Lok Sabha**

### State-Level Bicameralism

The Constitution has given the States the option of establishing either a unicameral or bicameral legislature. At present only six States have a bicameral legislature:

**States having a bicameral legislature:**
1. Andhra Pradesh
2. Bihar
3. Karnataka
4. Maharashtra
5. Telangana
6. Uttar Pradesh

### Advantages of Bicameralism

Countries with large size and much diversity usually prefer to have two houses of the national legislature to:
- Give representation to all sections in the society
- Give representation to all geographical regions or parts of the country

**A bicameral legislature has one more advantage.** A bicameral legislature makes it possible to have every decision reconsidered. Every decision taken by one house goes to the other house for its decision. This means that every bill and policy would be discussed twice. This ensures a double check on every matter. Even if one house takes a decision in haste, that decision will come for discussion in the other house and reconsideration will be possible.

---

## RAJYA SABHA: THE COUNCIL OF STATES

### Basis of Representation

Each of the two Houses of Parliament has different bases of representation. The **Rajya Sabha represents the States of India.** It is an indirectly elected body. Residents of the State elect members to State Legislative Assembly. The elected members of State Legislative Assembly in turn elect the members of the Rajya Sabha.

### Constitutional Assembly Perspective

> *"...an Upper House could perform the...useful function of being a revising body, and ...its views may count but not its votes... ...,those who could not enter into the rough and tumble of active politics could...advise the Lower House."*
> 
> **Purnima Banerji**
> *CAD, Vol. IX, p. 33, 30 July 1949*

### Principles of Representation

We can imagine two different principles of representation in the second chamber:

1. **Symmetrical Representation**: Give equal representation to all the parts of the country irrespective of their size or population

2. **Population-Based Representation**: Parts of the country may be given representation according to their population

### Comparison with the American System

In the USA, every state has equal representation in the Senate. This ensures equality of all the states. But this also means that a small state would have the same representation as the larger states. 

**The system of representation adopted for the Rajya Sabha is different from that in the USA.** The number of members to be elected from each State has been fixed by the fourth schedule of the Constitution.

**What would happen if we were to follow the American system of equality of representation in the Rajya Sabha?** Uttar Pradesh with a population of 1998.12 lakhs would get seats equal to that of Sikkim whose population is only 6.10 lakhs. The framers of the Constitution wanted to prevent such discrepancy. States with larger population get more representatives than States with smaller population get.

**Example**: A more populous State like Uttar Pradesh sends 31 members to the Rajya Sabha, while a smaller and less populous State like Sikkim has one seat in the Rajya Sabha.

### Term and Election Process

**Term Duration**: Members of the Rajya Sabha are elected for a term of six years. They can get re-elected.

**Staggered Elections**: All members of the Rajya Sabha do not complete their terms at the same time. Every two years, one third members of the Rajya Sabha complete their term and elections are held for those one third seats only. 

**Permanent House**: Thus, the Rajya Sabha is never fully dissolved. Therefore, it is called the **permanent House of the Parliament**. The advantage of this arrangement is that even when the Lok Sabha is dissolved and elections are yet to take place, the meeting of the Rajya Sabha can be called and urgent business can be conducted.

### Nominated Members

Apart from the elected members, Rajya Sabha also has **twelve nominated members**. The President nominates these members. These nominations are made from among those persons who have made their mark in the fields of literature, science, art and social service.

### International Example: Bicameralism in Germany

**Germany has a bicameral legislature.** The two Houses are known as:
- **Federal Assembly (Bundestag)**
- **Federal Council (Bundesrat)**

**Federal Assembly** is elected by a complex system combining direct and proportional representation for a period of four years.

**Federal Council Features**:
- The 16 federal states of Germany are represented in the Federal Council
- The 69 seats of the Bundesrat are divided among states on the basis of a range of populations
- These members are generally the ministers in the governments at the state level and are appointed, not elected, by the governments of the federal states
- According to the German law, all the members from one state have to vote as a bloc as per the instructions of the state governments
- Sometimes due to coalition government at the state level, they fail to reach an agreement and may have to abstain

**Legislative Powers**: The Bundesrat does not vote on all legislative initiatives but all the policy areas on which the federal states have concurrent powers and are responsible for federal regulations must be passed by it. It can also veto such legislation.

### Activity: State Representation Analysis
Find out the number of representatives elected from different States. Prepare a chart showing number of representatives and the population of the State according to the 2011 census.

---

## LOK SABHA: THE HOUSE OF THE PEOPLE

### Direct Democracy in Action

The **Lok Sabha and the State Legislative Assemblies are directly elected by the people.** For the purpose of election, the entire country (State, in case of State Legislative Assembly) is divided into territorial constituencies of roughly equal population. One representative is elected from each constituency through universal adult suffrage where the value of vote of every individual would be equal to another. 

**Current Composition**: At present there are 543 constituencies. This number has not changed since 1971 census.

### Term and Dissolution

**Term**: The Lok Sabha is elected for a period of five years. This is the maximum. 

**Early Dissolution**: Before the completion of five years, the Lok Sabha can be dissolved if:
- No party or coalition can form the government, OR
- The Prime Minister advises the President to dissolve the Lok Sabha and hold fresh elections

### Student Inquiry
*"I don't understand why there is a provision for nominating these sportspersons and artists and scientists. Whom do they represent? And, do they really contribute much to the proceedings of the Rajya Sabha?"*

### Check Your Progress Questions
- Do you think that composition of Rajya Sabha has protected the position of States of India?
- Should indirect election of Rajya Sabha be replaced by direct elections? What would be its advantages and disadvantages?
- Since 1971 census the number of seats in the Lok Sabha has not increased. Do you think that it should be increased? What should be the basis for this?

## WHAT DOES THE PARLIAMENT DO?

### Fundamental Questions
- What is the function of the legislature? 
- Do both Houses of the Parliament have similar functions? 
- Is there a difference in the powers of the two Houses?

Apart from law making, the Parliament is engaged in many other functions.

### Functions of the Parliament

#### 1. Legislative Function
The Parliament enacts legislations for the country. Despite being the chief law making body, the Parliament often merely approves legislations. The actual task of drafting the bill is performed by the bureaucracy under the supervision of the minister concerned. The substance and even the timing of the bill are decided by the Cabinet. No major bill is introduced in the Parliament without the approval of the Cabinet. Members other than ministers can also introduce bills but these have no chance of being passed without the support of the government.

#### 2. Control of Executive and Ensuring its Accountability
Perhaps the most vital function of the Parliament is to ensure that the executive does not overstep its authority and remains responsible to the people who have elected them. We shall discuss this function in greater detail later in this chapter.

#### 3. Financial Function
Government is about spending a lot of money on various matters. Where does this money come from? Every government raises resources through taxation. However, in a democracy, legislature controls taxation and the way in which money is used by the government. If the Government of India proposes to introduce any new tax, it has to get the approval of the Lok Sabha. 

**Key Aspects of Financial Control**:
- Grant of resources to the government to implement its programmes
- Government accountability for money spent and resources it wishes to raise
- Ensuring the government does not misspend or overspend
- This is done through the budget and annual financial statements

#### 4. Representation
Parliament represents the divergent views of members from different regional, social, economic, religious groups of different parts of the country.

#### 5. Debating Function
**The Parliament is the highest forum of debate in the country.** There is no limitation on its power of discussion. Members are free to speak on any matter without fear. This makes it possible for the Parliament to analyse any or every issue that faces the nation. These discussions constitute the heart of democratic decision making.

### Political Cartoon Analysis
*"The Parliament is the boss and the ministers are looking very humble here. That is the effect of the Parliament's power to sanction money to different ministries."*

*Shankar. Copyright: Children's Book Trust. 3 April 1955*

#### 6. Constituent Function
The Parliament has the power of discussing and enacting changes to the Constitution. The constituent powers of both the houses are similar. All constitutional amendments have to be approved by a special majority of both Houses.

#### 7. Electoral Functions
The Parliament also performs some electoral functions. It elects the President and Vice President of India.

#### 8. Judicial Functions
The judicial functions of the Parliament include considering the proposals for removal of President, Vice-President and Judges of High Courts and Supreme Court.

## POWERS OF THE TWO HOUSES

### Powers of Rajya Sabha

- **Legislative Powers**: Considers and approves non money bills and suggests amendments to money bills
- **Constitutional Role**: Approves constitutional amendments
- **Executive Control**: Exercises control over executive by asking questions, introducing motions and resolutions
- **Electoral Functions**: Participates in the election and removal of the President, Vice President, Judges of Supreme Court and High Court. It can alone initiate the procedure for removal of Vice President
- **Federal Powers**: Can give the Union parliament power to make laws on matters included in the State list

### Powers of the Lok Sabha

- **Legislative Authority**: Makes Laws on matters included in Union List and Concurrent List. Can introduce and enact money and non money bills
- **Financial Control**: Approves proposals for taxation, budgets and annual financial statements
- **Executive Accountability**: Controls the executive by asking questions, supplementary questions, resolutions and motions and through no confidence motion
- **Constitutional Powers**: Amends the Constitution
- **Emergency Powers**: Approves the Proclamation of emergency
- **Electoral Functions**: Elects the President and Vice President and removes Judges of Supreme Court and High Court
- **Administrative Oversight**: Establishes committees and commissions and considers their reports

### Special Powers of Rajya Sabha

As you know, the Rajya Sabha is an institutional mechanism to provide representation to the States. Its purpose is to protect the powers of the States. Therefore, any matter that affects the States must be referred to it for its consent and approval. 

**Federal Protection Role**: If the Union Parliament wishes to remove a matter from the State list (over which only the State Legislature can make law) to either the Union List or Concurrent List in the interest of the nation, the approval of the Rajya Sabha is necessary. This provision adds to the strength of the Rajya Sabha. 

**Practical Reality**: However, experience shows that the members of the Rajya Sabha represent their parties more than they represent their States.

### Powers Exercised Only by the Lok Sabha

**Financial Supremacy**: The Rajya Sabha cannot initiate, reject or amend money bills. 

**Executive Accountability**: The Council of Ministers is responsible to the Lok Sabha and not Rajya Sabha. Therefore, Rajya Sabha can criticise the government but cannot remove it.

**Democratic Logic**: Can you explain why? The Rajya Sabha is elected by the MLAs and not directly by the people. Therefore, the Constitution stopped short of giving certain powers to the Rajya Sabha. In a democratic form as adopted by our Constitution, the people are the final authority. By this logic, the representatives, directly elected by the people, should have the crucial powers of removing a government and controlling the finances.

**Equal Powers**: In all other spheres, including passing of non-money bills, constitutional amendments, and impeaching the President and removing the Vice President the powers of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha are co-equal.

### Student Observation
*"So, the Lok Sabha controls the purse! Then it must be the more powerful House."*

## HOW DOES THE PARLIAMENT MAKE LAWS?

### The Legislative Process

The basic function of any legislature is to make laws for its people. A definite procedure is followed in the process of making law. Some of the procedures of law making are mentioned in the Constitution, while some have evolved from conventions. Follow a bill through the legislative process and you will clearly see that the law making process is technical and even tedious.

### Flowchart of Law Making Process

```
Peoples' inputs
    ↓
Introduction in either House (in case of non-money bill)
    ↓
Bill Sent to Committee OR discussed in the House itself
    ↓
Committee gives report
    ↓
House may or may not accept the report
    ↓
Detailed discussion of bill in House
    ↓
Bill is accepted or rejected
    ↓
Sent to the Other House
    ↓
Other House approves or gives recommendations
    ↓
Joint Session of Parliament (if required)
    ↓
President approves or sends back for reconsideration
    ↓
Bill becomes Law
```

### Types of Bills

**Classification by Proposer**:
- **Government Bill**: A bill proposed by a minister
- **Private Member's Bill**: When a non-minister proposes a bill

**Classification by Nature**:
- **Money Bill**: Can only be introduced in Lok Sabha
- **Non-Money Bill**: Can be introduced in either house
- **Ordinary Bill**: Regular legislation
- **Constitution Amendment Bill**: For constitutional changes

### Pre-Introduction Stage

Even before a bill is introduced in the Parliament there may be a lot of debate on the need for introducing such a bill. Various factors influence this:

**Political Pressure**:
- A political party may pressurise the government to initiate a bill in order to fulfil its election promises
- To improve chances of winning forthcoming elections

**Social Advocacy**:
- Interest groups, media and citizens' forums may also persuade the government for a particular legislation

**Political Nature**: Law making is thus not merely a legal procedure but also a political course of action.

### Bill Preparation Considerations

The preparation of a bill itself involves many considerations:
- Resources required to implement the law
- The support or opposition that the bill is likely to produce
- The impact that the law may have on the electoral prospect of the ruling party

**Coalition Era Challenges**: In the era of coalition politics especially, a bill proposed by the government has to be acceptable to all the partners of the coalition. Such practical considerations can hardly be ignored. The Cabinet considers all these before arriving at a decision to enact a law.

### Drafting and Introduction

**Drafting Process**: Once the Cabinet approves the policy behind the legislation, the task of drafting the legislation begins. The draft of any bill is prepared by the concerned ministry. 

**Example**: A bill raising the marriageable age of girls from 18 to 21 will be prepared by the law ministry. The ministry of women and child welfare may also be involved in it.

**Introduction in Parliament**: Within the Parliament, a bill may be introduced in the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha by a member of the House (but often a minister responsible for the subject introduces the bill). A money bill can be introduced only in Lok Sabha. Once passed there, it is sent to the Rajya Sabha.

### Committee Stage

A large part of the discussion on the bills takes place in the committees. The recommendation of the committee is then sent to the House. **That is why committees are referred to as miniature legislatures.** This is the second stage in the law making process.

### Final Voting Stage

In the third and final stage, the bill is voted upon. If a non-money bill is passed by one House, it is sent to the other House where it goes through exactly the same procedure.

### Resolving Disagreements

As you know, a bill has to be passed by both Houses for enactment. If there is disagreement between the two Houses on the proposed bill, attempt is made to resolve it through **Joint Session of Parliament**. In the few instances when joint sessions of the parliament were called to resolve a deadlock, the decision has always gone in favour of the Lok Sabha.

### Money Bill Procedure

If it is a money bill, the Rajya Sabha can either approve the bill or suggest changes but cannot reject it. If it takes no action within 14 days the bill is deemed to have been passed. Amendments to the bill, suggested by Rajya Sabha, may or may not be accepted by the Lok Sabha.

### Presidential Assent

When a bill is passed by both Houses, it is sent to the President for his assent. The assent of the President results in the enactment of a bill into a law.

### Constitutional Provision

**Article 109 - Special procedure in respect of Money Bills**:
*(1) A Money Bill shall not be introduced in the Council of States*

### Political Commentary
*"Is this how they follow the 'rules of the game'?"*
*R K Laxman in The Times of India*

### Check Your Progress
From the discussion of the law making process, do you think that Parliament can devote enough time for thorough discussion of the bills? If not, then what remedies would you suggest to overcome this difficulty?

## HOW DOES THE PARLIAMENT CONTROL THE EXECUTIVE?

### The Democratic Challenge

In a parliamentary democracy, the executive is drawn from the party or a coalition of parties that has a majority in Lok Sabha. It is not difficult for the executive to exercise unlimited and arbitrary powers with the support of the majority party. In such a situation, parliamentary democracy may slip into **Cabinet dictatorship**, where the Cabinet leads and the House merely follows. 

**Parliamentary Vigilance**: Only if the Parliament is active and vigilant, can it keep regular and effective check on the executive.

### Parliamentary Privilege

There are many ways in which the Parliament can control the executive. But basic to them all is the power and freedom of the legislators as people's representatives to work effectively and fearlessly. For instance, **no action can be taken against a member for whatever the member may have said in the legislature.**

**Definition**: This is known as **parliamentary privilege**. The presiding officer of the legislature has the final powers in deciding matters of breach of privilege.

**Purpose**: The main purpose of such privileges is to enable the members of the legislature to represent the people and exercise effective control over the executive.

### Key Questions
- How does the Parliament exercise such control? 
- What are the means available at its disposal? 
- Is parliamentary control successful in curbing executive excesses?

---

## INSTRUMENTS OF PARLIAMENTARY CONTROL

The legislature in parliamentary system ensures executive accountability at various stages: policy making, implementation of law or policy and during and post-implementation stage. The legislature does this through the use of a variety of devices:

### 1. Deliberation and Discussion

#### Question Hour
**Most Effective Method**: Perhaps the question hour is the most effective method of keeping vigil on the executive and the administrative agencies of the government. Members of Parliament have shown great interest in question hour and maximum attendance is recorded during this time. 

**Purpose and Impact**: Most of the questions aim at eliciting information from the government on issues of public interest such as:
- Price rise
- Availability of food grains
- Atrocities on weaker sections of the society
- Riots
- Black-marketing

This gives the members an opportunity to criticise the government, and represent the problems of their constituencies.

**Dramatic Proceedings**: The discussions during the question hour are so heated that it is not uncommon to see members raise their voice, walk to the well of the house or walk out in protest to make their point. This results in considerable loss of legislative time. At the same time, we must remember that many of these actions are political techniques to gain concessions from government and in the process force executive accountability.

#### Other Discussion Forums
- **Zero Hour**: Members are free to raise any matter that they think is important (though the ministers are not bound to reply)
- **Half-an-hour discussion** on matters of public importance
- **Adjournment motion**

### Student Reflection
*"It must be difficult to be a minister. This is like giving an examination almost every day!"*

### 2. Approval and Ratification of Laws

**Constitutional Requirement**: A bill can become a law only with the approval of the Parliament. A government that has the support of a disciplined majority may not find it difficult to get the approval of the Legislature. 

**Political Reality**: Such approvals however, cannot be taken for granted. They are the products of intense bargaining and negotiations amongst the members of ruling party or coalition of parties and even government and opposition. 

**Historical Examples**: 
- If the government has majority in Lok Sabha but not in the Rajya Sabha, as has happened during the Janata Party rule in 1977 and N.D.A. rule in 2000, the government will be forced to make substantial concessions to gain the approval of both the Houses
- Many bills, such as the **Lok Pal Bill** have failed enactment
- **Prevention of Terrorism bill (2002)** was rejected by the Rajya Sabha

### 3. Financial Control

**Constitutional Obligation**: Preparation and presentation of budget for the approval of the legislature is constitutional obligation of the government. This obligation allows the legislature to exercise control over the purse strings of the government. 

**Powers of Financial Control**:
- The legislature may refuse to grant resources to the government
- Before granting money the Lok Sabha can discuss the reasons for which the government requires money
- It can enquire into cases of misuse of funds on the basis of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Public Accounts committees

**Policy Control**: But the legislative control is not only aimed at financial propriety. The legislature is concerned about the policies of the government that are reflected in the budget. Through financial control, the legislature controls the policy of the government.

### 4. No Confidence Motion

**Most Powerful Weapon**: The most powerful weapon that enables the Parliament to ensure executive accountability is the no-confidence motion. 

**Theoretical vs Practical Power**: As long as the government has the support of its party or coalition of parties that have a majority in the Lok Sabha, the power of the House to dismiss the government is fictional rather than real. 

**Post-1989 Reality**: However, after 1989, several governments have been forced to resign due to lack of confidence of the house. Each of these governments lost the confidence of the Lok Sabha because they failed to retain the support of their coalition partners.

### Effectiveness and Challenges

**Potential for Control**: Thus, the Parliament can effectively control the executive and ensure a more responsive government. 

**Requirements for Effectiveness**: It is however important for this purpose, that there is:
- Adequate time at the disposal of the House
- Members are interested in discussion and participate effectively
- Willingness to compromise amongst the government and the opposition

**Contemporary Challenges**: In the last two decades, there has been a gradual decline in:
- Sessions of the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies
- Time spent on debates
- Houses plagued by absence of quorum, boycott of sessions by members of opposition which deprive the house the power to control the executive through discussion

### Student Commentary
*"With so many sting operations are MPs still free to speak anything anywhere?"*

### Activity: Parliament Watching
Watch the Dooradarshan telecast of Parliament sessions for three continuous days. Or collect the newspaper reports for three continuous days and make a wallpaper. Take care to observe:
- The issues being discussed
- The role of the speaker
- Questions being asked
- The political parties of the representatives
- Representatives from your region
- Nature of the issues of discussion – whether they were all of national or regional in character

## WHAT DO THE COMMITTEES OF PARLIAMENT DO?

### Importance of Committee System

A significant feature of the legislative process is the appointment of committees for various legislative purposes. These committees play a vital role not merely in law making, but also in the day-to-day business of the House. 

**Time Constraints**: Since the Parliament meets only during sessions, it has very limited time at its disposal. The making of law for instance requires in-depth study of the issue under consideration. This in turn demands more attention and time.

### Functions of Parliamentary Committees

**Diverse Responsibilities**: There are other important functions also, like:
- Studying the demands for grants made by various ministries
- Looking into expenditure incurred by various departments
- Investigating cases of corruption

Parliamentary committees perform such functions.

### Standing Committees

**Development Since 1983**: Since 1983, India has developed a system of parliamentary standing committees. There are over twenty such departmentally related committees. 

**Supervisory Role**: Standing Committees supervise:
- The work of various departments
- Their budget
- Their expenditure
- Bills that come up in the house relating to the department

### Joint Parliamentary Committees (JPCs)

Apart from standing committees, the Joint Parliamentary Committees have occupied a position of eminence in our country. 

**Purposes of JPCs**:
- Discussing a particular bill, like the joint committee to discuss bill
- Investigating financial irregularities

**Composition**: Members of these committees are selected from both Houses.

### Impact on Parliamentary Functioning

**Reduced Burden**: The committee system has reduced the burden on the Parliament. Many important bills have been referred to committees. The Parliament has merely approved the work done in the committees with few occasional alterations.

**Legal Authority**: Of course legally speaking, no bill can become law, and no budget will be sanctioned unless approved by the Parliament. But the Parliament rarely rejects the suggestions made by the committees.

### Political Cartoon Commentary
*"Walkout is a frequently adopted measure by the opposition to register their protest against the government. Has there been an overuse of that weapon?"*
*Irfan*

## HOW DOES THE PARLIAMENT REGULATE ITSELF?

### Parliamentary Conduct and Procedure

Parliament as mentioned earlier is a debating forum. It is through debates that the parliament performs all its vital functions. Such discussions must be meaningful and orderly so that the functions of the Parliament are carried out smoothly and its dignity is intact. 

**Constitutional Framework**: The Constitution itself has made certain provisions to ensure smooth conduct of business. The presiding officer of the legislature is the final authority in matters of regulating the business of the legislature.

### Constitutional Assembly Perspective

> *"The nature of the legislature is such that there are restrictions only so far as procedure is concerned. But in substance there is no restriction, no limitation on the sovereignty of the legislature or Parliament…"*
> 
> **N.V. Gadgil**
> *CAD, Vol. XI, p.659, 18 November 1949*

### The Anti-Defection Law

There is one more way in which the presiding officers control the behaviour of the members. You may have heard about the **anti-defection law**. Most of the members of the legislatures are elected on the ticket of some political party. What would happen if they decide to leave the party after getting elected?

#### Historical Development
For many years after independence, this issue was unresolved. Finally there was an agreement among the parties that a legislator who is elected on one party's ticket must be restricted from 'defecting' to another party. 

**Constitutional Amendment**: An amendment to the Constitution was made (**52nd amendment act**) in 1985. This is known as **anti-defection amendment**. It has also been subsequently modified by the **91st amendment**.

#### Authority and Consequences
**Decision Making**: The presiding officer of the House is the authority who takes final decisions on all such cases.

**Penalties**: If it is proved that a member has 'defected', then such member loses the membership of the House. Besides, such a person is also disqualified from holding any political office like ministership, etc.

#### Definition of Defection
**What is defection?** If a member:
- Remains absent in the House when asked by the party leadership to remain present, OR
- Votes against the instructions of the party, OR 
- Voluntarily leaves the membership of the party

It is deemed as defection.

#### Assessment of the Anti-Defection Law
**Limited Success**: Experience of the past twenty years shows that the anti-defection amendment has not been able to curb defections, but it has given additional powers to the party leadership and the presiding officers of the legislatures over the members.

### Student Inquiry
*"I don't understand why they change parties. Do they even come back to the party they once left?"*

### Political Cartoon Analysis
*"We are not walking out, we have been ordered out," said the MPs. Why do you think such situations occur?*
*Irfan*

### Constitutional Commentary
*"So, the lawmakers too, are subject to some laws!"*

## CONCLUSION

### Parliament as India's Rainbow

Have you watched the live telecast of the proceeding of the Parliament? You will find that our Parliament is truly a **rainbow of colourful dresses symbolising different regions of the country**. Members speak different languages in the course of the proceedings. They come from various castes, religions and sects. They often fight bitterly. Many times an impression is created that they are wasting the time and money of the nation.

### Democratic Potential Realized

But we have seen in this chapter that these same parliamentarians can effectively control the executive. They can express the interests of various sections of our society. **On account of its composition, Legislature is the most representative of all organs of government.** The sheer presence of members of diverse social backgrounds makes the legislatures more representative and potentially more responsive to people's expectations.

### Central Role in Democracy

**In a parliamentary democracy, legislature, as a body representing the wishes of the people occupies a high position of power and responsibility. Herein lies the democratic potential of the Parliament.**

# Chapter 6: Judiciary
## Indian Constitution at Work

---

## Introduction: The Political Role of Judiciary

The judiciary extends far beyond its traditional role as an arbitrator in private disputes. As an essential organ of government, the judiciary performs crucial political functions that shape the democratic fabric of the nation.

**The Supreme Court of India** stands as one of the most powerful courts globally, playing a vital role since 1950 in:
- Interpreting the Constitution
- Protecting fundamental rights
- Maintaining the rule of law
- Ensuring democratic governance

### Learning Objectives
After studying this chapter, you will understand:
- The meaning of independence of judiciary
- The role of Indian Judiciary in protecting our rights
- The role of the Judiciary in interpreting the Constitution
- The relationship between the Judiciary and Parliament

---

## Why Do We Need an Independent Judiciary?

### The Foundation of Rule of Law

In any society, disputes inevitably arise between:
- Individuals
- Groups
- Individuals/groups and government

**The Rule of Law Principle** requires that all disputes be settled by an independent body, ensuring that all individuals—regardless of wealth, gender, or caste—are subject to the same law.

### Primary Functions of the Judiciary

The judiciary serves several essential functions:
- **Protecting rule of law** and ensuring supremacy of law
- **Safeguarding individual rights**
- **Settling disputes** in accordance with law
- **Preventing democratic decay** into individual or group dictatorship

> *"No fisticuffs please, this is rule of law!"* - R K Laxman, The Times of India

### Understanding Judicial Independence

**Independence of judiciary means:**
- Other government organs (executive and legislature) must not restrain judicial functioning
- No interference with judicial decisions
- Judges must perform functions without fear or favor

**Important Note:** Independence does not mean arbitrariness or absence of accountability. The judiciary remains accountable to:
- The Constitution
- Democratic traditions
- The people of the country

---

## Constitutional Safeguards for Judicial Independence

### Appointment Process
- **Legislature is not involved** in judicial appointments
- **Merit-based selection** requiring legal experience and knowledge
- **Political opinions should not influence** appointments

### Security of Tenure
- **Fixed tenure** until retirement age
- **Exceptional removal** procedures only
- **Difficult removal process** provides security of office

### Financial Independence
- **Salaries and allowances** not subject to legislative approval
- **No financial dependence** on executive or legislature

### Protection from Criticism
- **Immunity from personal criticism** for judicial actions and decisions
- **Contempt of court powers** to penalize unfair criticism
- **Parliamentary restrictions** on discussing judicial conduct (except during removal proceedings)

---

## Appointment and Removal of Judges

### Appointment Controversies

The appointment process has never been free from political controversy, involving:
- Council of Ministers
- Governors and Chief Ministers
- Chief Justice of India

**Chief Justice of India (CJI) Appointment:**
- **Convention:** Senior-most judge appointed as CJI
- **Exceptions:** Convention broken twice (1973 - A.N. Ray; 1975 - Justice M.H. Beg)

### The Collegium System

**Evolution of Appointment Process (1982-1998):**
1. **Initial View:** Chief Justice's role purely consultative
2. **Revised View:** President must follow CJI's opinion
3. **Current System:** Collegium of senior judges makes recommendations

**Present System:** CJI recommends names in consultation with four senior-most Supreme Court judges, establishing the principle of collegiality.

### Removal of Judges

**Grounds for Removal:**
- Proven misbehavior
- Incapacity

**Removal Procedure:**
- Motion with charges approved by **special majority in both Houses of Parliament**
- **Extremely difficult process** ensuring judicial security
- **Balance of power:** Executive appoints, Legislature removes

### Case Study: Unsuccessful Removal Attempt (1991)

**Justice V. Ramaswami Case:**
- **Charges:** Misappropriation of funds as Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana High Court
- **Inquiry Findings:** Guilty of "wilful and gross misuses of office... and moral turpitude"
- **Parliamentary Motion:** Achieved two-thirds majority among present members but failed to get majority of total House strength due to Congress abstention
- **Result:** Judge survived the removal motion

---

## Structure of the Judiciary

### Single Integrated Judicial System

Unlike federal countries with separate state courts, India maintains a **unified judicial structure** with the Constitution providing for a single integrated judicial system.

### Pyramidal Structure

```
Supreme Court of India (Apex)
├── Decisions binding on all courts
├── Can transfer High Court judges
├── Can move cases from any court to itself
└── Can transfer cases between High Courts

High Courts (State Level)
├── Hear appeals from lower courts
├── Issue writs for Fundamental Rights
├── Handle cases within state jurisdiction
└── Exercise superintendence over lower courts

District Courts (District Level)
├── Handle district-level cases
├── Consider appeals from subordinate courts
└── Decide serious criminal offenses

Subordinate Courts (Local Level)
└── Handle civil and criminal cases
```

---

## Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court

### Types of Jurisdiction

**The Supreme Court operates under four distinct jurisdictions:**

### 1. Original Jurisdiction
- **Direct consideration** of cases without going to lower courts
- **Federal disputes** between Union and States, and among States
- **Umpire role** in federal matters
- **Constitutional interpretation** of Union and State powers

### 2. Writ Jurisdiction
**Five types of writs for protecting Fundamental Rights:**
- **Habeas Corpus** - Protection against illegal detention
- **Mandamus** - Compelling public officials to perform duties
- **Prohibition** - Preventing lower courts from exceeding jurisdiction
- **Certiorari** - Reviewing lower court decisions
- **Quo Warranto** - Questioning authority to hold public office

**Accessibility:** Citizens can approach either High Courts or Supreme Court directly for writ remedies.

### 3. Appellate Jurisdiction
- **Highest court of appeal** from High Court decisions
- **Certification requirement:** High Court must certify case fit for appeal
- **Criminal cases:** Automatic appeal in death sentence cases
- **Discretionary powers:** Supreme Court can admit appeals even when High Court refuses certification

### 4. Advisory Jurisdiction
- **Presidential reference** of matters of public importance
- **Constitutional interpretation** advice
- **Non-binding nature:** Court not bound to advise, President not bound to accept

**Utility of Advisory Powers:**
- Allows government to seek legal opinion before action
- Prevents unnecessary future litigation
- Enables suitable changes in government actions/legislation

### Special Constitutional Provisions

> **Article 137:** "...the Supreme Court shall have power to review any judgment pronounced or order made by it."

> **Article 144:** "...All authorities, civil and judicial, in the territory of India shall act in aid of the Supreme Court."

**Key Features:**
- **Binding decisions** on all courts in India
- **Enforceable orders** throughout the country
- **Self-review power** - not bound by own previous decisions
- **Contempt jurisdiction** - decides cases of contempt against itself

---

## Judicial Activism and Public Interest Litigation

### Understanding Judicial Activism

**Judicial Activism** represents a transformation in judicial functioning, moving beyond traditional case-by-case adjudication to proactive protection of rights and public interest.

### Public Interest Litigation (PIL) - The Game Changer

**Definition:** Cases filed not by aggrieved persons but by others on their behalf for public interest.

**Historical Development:**
- **1979:** Trend began with cases filed by advocates on behalf of aggrieved parties
- **Evolution:** Courts began considering cases based on newspaper reports and postal complaints

### Landmark Early PILs

**1. Hussainara Khatoon vs. Bihar (1979)**
- **Issue:** Under-trial prisoners in Bihar spending longer in jail than potential punishment
- **Trigger:** Newspaper reports
- **Significance:** Established PIL as vehicle for justice

**2. Sunil Batra vs. Delhi Administration (1980)**
- **Issue:** Physical torture of Tihar jail prisoners
- **Trigger:** Handwritten complaint to Justice Krishna Iyer
- **Impact:** Opened courts to direct citizen complaints

### Expanded Concept of Rights Through PIL

**New Rights Recognition:**
- Clean air and unpolluted water
- Decent living conditions
- Environmental protection
- Rights of disadvantaged sections

> **Justice Bhagwati in Bandhua Mukti Morcha vs. Union of India (1984):**
> *"It must be remembered that the problems of the poor...are qualitatively different from those which have hitherto occupied the attention of the Court and they need...a different kind of judicial approach. If we blindly follow the adversarial procedure in their case, they would never be able to enforce their fundamental rights."*

### Positive Impact of Judicial Activism

**Democratization of Justice:**
- Access to courts for individuals and groups
- Forced executive accountability
- Electoral system improvements (candidate affidavits requirement)

**Rights Protection:**
- Consideration of violations against vulnerable groups
- Cases involving bonded labor, child exploitation, environmental degradation
- Prison reform and human rights protection

### Criticisms and Concerns

**Negative Aspects:**
- **Court overburden** due to excessive PILs
- **Blurred separation of powers** between executive, legislature, and judiciary
- **Judicial overreach** into executive and legislative domains
- **Democratic balance concerns** - each organ must respect others' jurisdiction

---

## Judiciary and Rights Protection

### Constitutional Mechanisms for Rights Protection

The Constitution provides **two primary ways** for the Supreme Court to remedy rights violations:

### 1. Writ Power (Article 32 & 226)
- **Supreme Court:** Article 32 - "Right to Constitutional Remedies"
- **High Courts:** Article 226 - Broader writ jurisdiction
- **Types:** Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, Prohibition, Certiorari, Quo Warranto

### 2. Judicial Review (Article 13)
- **Power to declare laws unconstitutional**
- **Constitutional supremacy** over legislative enactments
- **Protection against legislative overreach**

### Understanding Judicial Review

**Definition:** Power of Supreme Court and High Courts to examine constitutionality of any law and declare it unconstitutional if inconsistent with Constitutional provisions.

**Key Features:**
- **Not explicitly mentioned** in Constitution but implicit in written constitution structure
- **Fundamental rights protection** against legislative violation
- **Federal balance maintenance** - reviewing laws against distribution of powers
- **Both Central and State laws** subject to review

**Scope of Review Power:**
- Laws violating Fundamental Rights
- Laws violating federal distribution of powers
- Constitutional interpretation authority

### Impact on Disadvantaged Sections

**Rights Against Exploitation:**
Through PIL and judicial activism, courts have addressed:
- Forced labor cases
- Human trafficking
- Child labor in hazardous industries
- Police brutality (blinding of jail inmates)
- Inhuman working conditions
- Sexual exploitation of children

**Global Recognition:**
- PIL practice spreading to other countries
- **South Africa:** Constitutional incorporation of PIL in Bill of Rights
- **Regional Influence:** South Asia and Africa adopting similar judicial activism

---

## Judiciary and Parliament Relations

### Constitutional Framework of Separation of Powers

The Indian Constitution operates on **limited separation of powers and checks and balances:**

**Parliamentary Supremacy:**
- Law-making authority
- Constitutional amendment power

**Executive Supremacy:**
- Implementation of laws
- Administrative functions

**Judicial Supremacy:**
- Dispute settlement
- Constitutional interpretation
- Judicial review of laws

### Historical Conflicts: The Property Rights Controversy

**Core Issues of Conflict (Post-1950):**

1. **Scope of right to private property**
2. **Parliament's power to curtail fundamental rights**
3. **Parliament's constitutional amendment power**
4. **Laws abridging rights while enforcing Directive Principles**

### Intensification of Conflict (1967-1973)

**Areas of Dispute:**
- Land reform laws
- Preventive detention laws
- Job reservation regulations
- Private property acquisition for public purposes
- Compensation for property acquisition

### The Kesavananda Bharati Case (1973) - Watershed Moment

**Revolutionary Ruling:**
1. **Basic Structure Doctrine:** Constitution has basic structure that cannot be violated by anyone, including Parliament through amendments
2. **Property Rights:** Right to property not part of basic structure, can be suitably abridged
3. **Judicial Authority:** Supreme Court reserves right to determine what constitutes basic structure

**Impact:**
- **Changed nature** of legislature-judiciary conflicts
- **Right to property removed** from Fundamental Rights (1979)
- **Improved relations** between the two organs

### Ongoing Areas of Tension

**Unresolved Issues:**
- Judicial intervention in legislative functioning
- Parliamentary privilege vs. judicial protection
- Legislative punishment vs. court protection
- Parliamentary sovereignty vs. judicial oversight

> **Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar, Constituent Assembly Debates (1949):**
> *"While there can be no two opinions on the need for the maintenance of judicial independence, ...it is also necessary to keep in view one important principle. The doctrine of independence is not to be raised to the level of a dogma so as to enable the judiciary to function as a kind of super-legislature or super-executive. The judiciary is there to interpret the Constitution or adjudicate upon the rights..."*

### Contemporary Judicial Interventions

**Active Judicial Role in Administration:**
- **CBI investigations:** Hawala case, Narasimha Rao case, illegal petrol pump allotments
- **Electoral reforms:** Candidate disclosure requirements
- **Anti-corruption measures:** Direct court supervision
- **Administrative directions:** To various government agencies

---

## Contemporary Challenges and Expectations

### Increased Judicial Prestige and Expectations

**Positive Developments:**
- Enhanced public trust in judiciary
- Greater accessibility through PIL
- Protection of vulnerable sections
- Constitutional interpretation evolution

### Ongoing Concerns

**Public Perception Issues:**
- Easy acquittals for wealthy and influential
- Witness manipulation
- **"Justice delayed is justice denied"** concerns
- Corruption in judicial processes

**Systemic Challenges:**
- Case backlogs and delays
- Resource constraints
- Balancing activism with restraint
- Maintaining democratic balance

### The Delicate Democratic Balance

**Key Principle:** Democracy depends on the careful balance of power between judiciary and Parliament, with both institutions functioning within Constitutional limitations.

**Essential Requirements:**
- Mutual respect between organs of government
- Constitutional adherence by all institutions
- Protection of democratic principles
- Effective checks and balances

---

## Conclusion: The Judiciary's Democratic Role

The Indian judiciary has emerged as a powerful and independent institution that has significantly shaped the country's democratic evolution. Through various landmark decisions, constitutional interpretations, and proactive rights protection, it has established itself as a guardian of democratic values.

**Key Achievements:**
- **Constitutional Protection:** Safeguarding fundamental rights and democratic principles
- **Rights Expansion:** Through PIL and judicial activism, making rights meaningful for all citizens
- **Institutional Balance:** Maintaining checks and balances with other government organs
- **Global Influence:** Indian judicial innovations like PIL inspiring international adoption

**Ongoing Responsibility:**
The judiciary continues to navigate the delicate balance between judicial activism and restraint, ensuring that its powerful role serves to strengthen rather than undermine democratic governance. As the guardian of the Constitution and protector of rights, the judiciary remains central to India's democratic success while continuously evolving to meet contemporary challenges.

**The Democratic Imperative:** The health of Indian democracy fundamentally depends on maintaining the independence, integrity, and effectiveness of the judiciary while ensuring it operates within constitutional bounds and democratic principles.

# Chapter 7: Federalism
## Indian Constitution at Work

---

## Introduction: The Evolving Map of India

The political maps of India from 1947 and 2017 tell a remarkable story of federal evolution. Boundaries have changed, states have been renamed, and new states have emerged. When India gained independence, we inherited provinces organized by the British for administrative convenience, along with numerous princely states that merged with the Indian union.

### Major Transformations Over Seven Decades
- **Boundary Changes**: States reorganized multiple times
- **Name Changes**: Mysore → Karnataka, Madras → Tamil Nadu
- **New State Formation**: Continuous process reflecting linguistic and cultural diversity
- **Federal Evolution**: Maps showcase the functioning of Indian federalism

### Chapter Learning Objectives
After studying this chapter, you will understand:
- What federalism means and its core principles
- Federal provisions embedded in the Indian Constitution
- Complex center-state relationship dynamics
- Special constitutional provisions for distinct states

---

## Understanding Federalism: Global Context and Lessons

### The Federal Challenge: Success and Failure Stories

#### Failed Federations - Learning from History
**USSR (Post-1989 Breakup)**
- Excessive centralization and power concentration
- Russian domination over regions with independent languages and cultures
- Example: Uzbekistan's struggle for cultural autonomy

**Other Divided Nations**
- Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Pakistan - all faced national division
- Canada's near-breakup between English and French-speaking regions

**West Indies Federation Case Study**
- Established: 1958 as British colonial federation
- Features: Weak central government, independent unit economies
- Dissolution: 1962 due to political competition among units
- Post-breakup: 1973 Treaty of Chiguaramas created Caribbean Community
- Current Status: Units cannot live together as one country, nor separately

#### India's Federal Success Story
India's achievement in maintaining unity over seven decades after painful partition represents a remarkable federal success. This achievement stems from:
- Appropriate federal constitutional design
- Nature of federal system implementation
- Practice of cooperative federalism

---

## Core Principles of Federalism

### India's Unity in Diversity Framework
India presents unique federal challenges:
- **Geographic Scale**: Continental proportions
- **Linguistic Diversity**: 20+ major languages, hundreds of minor ones
- **Religious Plurality**: Several major religions
- **Indigenous Communities**: Millions across different regions
- **Shared Elements**: Common landmass, independence struggle history

### Key Federal Concepts

#### 1. Dual Polity System
- **Institutional Mechanism**: Accommodates regional and national governance
- **Autonomy Principle**: Each government autonomous in its sphere
- **Citizenship**: India maintains single citizenship (unlike some federal countries with dual citizenship)

#### 2. Dual Identity and Loyalty
- **Regional Identity**: Gujaratis, Jharkhandis, etc.
- **National Identity**: Indians
- **Separate Powers**: Each level has distinct responsibilities and government systems

#### 3. Constitutional Framework
- **Written Constitution**: Supreme document spelling out dual government system
- **Power Distribution**: 
  - National subjects (defense, currency) → Union government
  - Regional/local matters → State governments

#### 4. Dispute Resolution Mechanism
- **Independent Judiciary**: Prevents center-state conflicts
- **Legal Settlement**: Court resolution of power division disputes

### Factors Determining Federal Success
- **Cultural Elements**: Trust, cooperation, mutual respect, restraint
- **Political Dynamics**: Role of political parties in constitutional functioning
- **Balance Prevention**: Avoiding domination by single unit, state, linguistic group, or ideology
- **Conflict Management**: Preventing secessionist demands and civil wars

---

## Federal Challenges: The Nigerian Example

### Nigeria's Federal Struggle
- **Historical Background**: Northern and Southern Nigeria separate until 1914
- **1950 Decision**: Ibadan Constitutional Conference chose federal constitution
- **Ethnic Dynamics**: Three major groups (Yoruba, Ibo, Hausa-Fulani) controlled West, East, and North regions
- **Conflict Genesis**: Regional influence expansion led to fears and military regime

### Constitutional Evolution
- **1960 Constitution**: Joint federal-regional control of Nigerian police
- **1979 Military Constitution**: No state civil police allowed
- **1999 Democracy Restoration**: Religious differences and oil revenue control continue creating federal problems
- **Ongoing Challenges**: Local ethnic communities resist centralized oil resource control

### Lessons for Federal Systems
Nigeria exemplifies the overlap of religious, ethnic, and economic differences among federal units, demonstrating how distrust can undermine even well-designed federal arrangements.

---

## Federalism in the Indian Constitution

### Pre-Independence Federal Awareness

#### National Movement Recognition
- **Geographic Reality**: Large country requiring power division between provinces and center
- **Diversity Acknowledgment**: Regional and linguistic diversity needed recognition
- **Democratic Logic**: Regional people should govern themselves through power-sharing

#### Pre-Partition Negotiations
- **Muslim League Demands**: Greater Muslim representation
- **Compromise Attempts**: Large regional powers discussed
- **Post-Partition Decision**: Constituent Assembly chose unity-cooperation model between center and states

### Constitutional Design Philosophy

#### Key Feature: Cooperative Federalism
The Indian Constitution emphasizes cooperation-based center-state relations while recognizing diversity and maintaining unity.

#### Constitutional Terminology
**Article 1** defines India's federal structure:
> (1) India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States.
> (2) The States and the territories thereof shall be as specified in the First Schedule.

**Note**: The Constitution deliberately avoids using the word "federation"

---

## Division of Powers: The Three-List System

### Constitutional Government Structure
- **Union Government**: For entire nation (central government)
- **State Governments**: For each unit/state
- **Constitutional Status**: Both have clearly identified activity areas
- **Dispute Resolution**: Judiciary resolves power distribution conflicts

### The Three Lists Explained

#### Union List (Exclusive Central Powers)
**Key Subjects Include:**
- Defense
- Atomic Energy
- Foreign Affairs
- War and Peace
- Banking
- Railways
- Post and Telegraph
- Airways
- Ports
- Foreign Trade
- Currency & Coinage

**Legislative Authority**: Union Legislature alone can make laws

#### State List (Exclusive State Powers)
**Key Subjects Include:**
- Agriculture
- Police
- Prison
- Local Government
- Public Health
- Land
- Liquor
- Trade and Commerce
- Livestock and Animal Husbandry
- State Public Services

**Legislative Authority**: Normally only State Legislature can make laws

#### Concurrent List (Shared Powers)
**Key Subjects Include:**
- Education
- Transfer of Property (other than agricultural land)
- Forests
- Trade Unions
- Adulteration
- Adoption and Succession

**Legislative Authority**: Both Union and State Legislatures can make laws

#### Residuary Powers
- **Coverage**: All matters not mentioned in any list
- **Example**: Cyber Laws
- **Authority**: Union Legislature alone has power to legislate

### Economic Power Centralization
**Critical Issue**: Economic and financial powers are centralized with the central government, while states have immense responsibilities but meager revenue sources.

---

## Federalism with Strong Central Government

### Constitutional Rationale for Strong Center

#### Historical Context Justification
**T.T. Krishnamachari's Explanation (Constituent Assembly, November 25, 1949):**
> "Let me tell my honourable Friends in the House that the drift... in all constitutions has been towards the centre... because of circumstances that have now come into being that the States have become, ...federal or unitary, welfare states from being Police States and the ultimate responsibility as for the economic well-being of the country has become the paramount responsibility of the centre."

#### Foundational Concerns
- **Unity Imperative**: Stem disintegration in diverse, continental-sized country
- **Integration Challenge**: 500+ princely states needed integration
- **Development Goals**: Socio-economic problems (poverty, illiteracy, wealth inequality) required central coordination and planning

### Provisions Creating Strong Central Government

#### 1. Parliamentary Supremacy Over States
- **Territorial Control**: Parliament can form new states by separating/uniting territories
- **Boundary Changes**: Alter state boundaries or names
- **Safeguards**: Concerned state legislature views must be secured

#### 2. Emergency Provisions
- **Federal Transformation**: Emergency converts federal system to highly centralized system
- **Power Centralization**: Parliament assumes power to make laws on state subjects during emergency
- **Constitutional Authority**: Emergency powers are constitutional and legal

#### 3. Financial Dominance
**Revenue Control**: Central government controls major revenue-generating items
**State Dependency**: States mostly dependent on central grants and financial assistance
**Planning Centralization**: 
- Planning Commission (union-appointed) coordinates and supervises state resource management
- Union discretionary grants and loans to states
- **Discrimination Charges**: Opposition-ruled states often charge discrimination in resource distribution

#### 4. Governor's Powers
- **Dismissal Recommendation**: Governor can recommend state government dismissal and assembly dissolution
- **Bill Reservation**: Governor can reserve state legislature bills for President's assent
- **Central Oversight**: Provides central government opportunity to delay/examine/veto state legislation

#### 5. Central Legislative Superiority
**Article 257 (1) - Executive Power Hierarchy:**
> "The executive power of every State shall be so exercised as not to impede or prejudice the exercise of the executive power of the Union, and the executive power of the Union shall extend to the giving of such directions to a State as may appear to the Government of India to be necessary for that purpose."

**Rajya Sabha Role**: Central government can legislate on state subjects if ratified by Rajya Sabha

#### 6. Integrated Administrative System
- **All-India Services**: Common to entire Indian territory
- **Officer Control**: IAS/IPS officers serve in state administration but remain under central control
- **State Limitations**: States cannot take disciplinary action or remove these officers

#### 7. Special Security Provisions
**Articles 33 and 34**: Parliament can protect union/state service persons during martial law
**Armed Forces Special Powers Act**: Based on these provisions, though creates tensions between people and armed forces

---

## Conflicts in India's Federal System

### The Political Nature of Federalism
The Constitution provides only a framework; actual political processes give federalism its "flesh and blood." Indian federalism has been significantly influenced by changing political dynamics.

### Evolution of Center-State Relations

#### Phase 1: Foundation Era (1950s-Early 1960s)
**Leadership**: Jawaharlal Nehru
**Political Context**: Congress dominance at center and states
**Relationship Quality**: Generally normal relations (except new state formation issues)
**State Expectations**: Progress through central grants-in-aid
**Atmosphere**: Optimism about central socio-economic development policies

#### Phase 2: Opposition Emergence (Mid-1960s)
**Political Shift**: Congress dominance declined, opposition parties gained state power
**Conflict Genesis**: Different parties ruling center and states
**State Response**: Protests against unnecessary central interference
**Central Response**: Congress discomfort with opposition state governments
**Key Development**: Birth of autonomy concept discussions in federal systems

#### Phase 3: Coalition Era (1990s-Present)
**Political Transformation**: End of Congress dominance, coalition politics emergence
**Power Distribution**: Different parties (national and regional) in various states
**Federal Maturation**: Greater state say, respect for diversity, mature federalism
**Autonomy Significance**: Second phase made autonomy politically potent

### State Autonomy Demands: Four Dimensions

#### 1. Power Division Changes
**Demand**: Shift division of powers favoring states
**Advocates**: 
- States: Tamil Nadu, Punjab, West Bengal
- Parties: DMK, Akali Dal, CPI-M
**Goal**: Assign more important powers to states

#### 2. Financial Autonomy
**Demand**: Independent revenue sources and greater resource control
**Historical Example**: 1977 Left Front Government in West Bengal document demanding center-state relations restructuring
**Support**: Tamil Nadu and Punjab autonomy demands included greater financial powers

#### 3. Administrative Powers
**Concern**: State resentment over central control of administrative machinery
**Demand**: Greater state control over administration

#### 4. Cultural and Linguistic Issues
**Examples**:
- Opposition to Hindi domination (Tamil Nadu)
- Punjabi language and culture advancement demands
- Resistance to Hindi-speaking area domination
- 1960s agitations against Hindi imposition

**Historical Context**: During Constituent Assembly national language discussions, Nehru appealed to Hindi-speaking provinces for greater tolerance toward others.

---

## Controversial Federal Issues

### Role of Governors and President's Rule

#### Governor Appointment Controversy
**Selection Issues**: 
- Non-elected office holder
- Often retired military officers, civil servants, or politicians
- Central government appointment creates perception of interference
- Particularly controversial when different parties control center and state

**Sarkaria Commission Recommendations (1983-1988)**:
- Examined center-state relations
- Recommended strictly non-partisan governor appointments

#### Article 356: President's Rule
**Constitutional Provision**: Most controversial article enabling President's rule in states
**Application Condition**: "A situation has arisen in which the Government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution"
**Process**: 
- Union government takes over state government
- President's proclamation requires Parliamentary ratification
- Can extend up to three years
- Governor recommends state government dismissal and assembly suspension/dissolution

#### Historical Misuse Patterns
**Pre-1967 Usage**: Very sparing application
**Post-1967 Trend**: 
- Many states had non-Congress governments
- Congress controlled center
- Frequent use to dismiss state governments
- Prevention of majority parties/coalitions from assuming office

**Notable Cases**:
- Kerala 1959: Government dismissed despite legislative majority
- Post-1967: Several states dismissed without majority testing
- 1980s: Andhra Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir elected governments removed
- Supreme Court intervention: Constitutional validity of President's rule decisions can be judicially examined

### Demand for New States

#### Historical Foundation
- National movement created pan-Indian unity
- Also generated distinct unity around common language, region, culture
- Democratic movement principles
- Decision: States created based on common cultural and linguistic identity

#### Post-Independence State Creation Process
**1953**: States Reorganisation Commission establishment
**Recommendation**: Linguistic states for major linguistic groups
**1956**: First major state reorganization

#### Major State Formations
- **1960**: Gujarat and Maharashtra
- **1966**: Punjab and Haryana separation
- **North Eastern Reorganization**: Manipur, Tripura, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh
- **2000**: Chhattisgarh (from Madhya Pradesh), Uttarakhand (from Uttar Pradesh), Jharkhand (from Bihar)
- **2014**: Telangana (from Andhra Pradesh)

#### Ongoing Demands
- **Current**: Vidarbha in Maharashtra
- **Rationale**: Both meeting separate state demands and improving administrative efficiency

### Interstate Conflicts

Interstate disputes present unique federal challenges requiring political negotiation rather than just legal arbitration.

#### 1. Border Disputes
**Nature**: States claim territories from neighboring states
**Complexity**: Border areas often have multi-lingual populations, making linguistic majority basis difficult
**Examples**:
- **Maharashtra vs Karnataka**: Long-standing dispute over Belgaum city
- **Manipur vs Nagaland**: Persistent border conflict
- **Punjab vs Haryana**: Border areas plus Chandigarh capital city dispute

**Chandigarh Issue**:
- Carved from Punjab to create Haryana
- Currently houses both state capitals
- 1985: PM Rajiv Gandhi agreement to hand over to Punjab (not yet implemented)

#### 2. River Water Disputes
**Significance**: More serious than border disputes due to drinking water and agriculture impacts
**Major Disputes**:
- **Cauvery**: Tamil Nadu vs Karnataka (farmers dependent on waters, reached Supreme Court via river water tribunal)
- **Narmada**: Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra dispute over water sharing

**Challenge**: Rivers are major resources, testing state patience and cooperative spirit

---

## Special Provisions for States

### Asymmetrical Federalism Concept
India's federal arrangement provides differential treatment to various states, representing extraordinary constitutional flexibility.

#### Rajya Sabha Representation
- **Asymmetrical Representation**: Accounts for different state sizes and populations
- **Balance**: Ensures minimum representation for smaller states while giving larger states more representation

### Special Constitutional Provisions

#### Primary Beneficiaries: North Eastern States
**States Covered**: Assam, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, etc.
**Rationale**: Sizeable indigenous tribal population with distinct history and culture
**Limitation**: Provisions haven't completely stemmed alienation and insurgency in parts of the region

#### Other Special Provision States
- **Hilly States**: Himachal Pradesh
- **Other States**: Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Sikkim, Telangana

### Jammu and Kashmir: Unique Constitutional Position

#### Historical Background
- **Status**: Large princely state with option to join India, Pakistan, or remain independent
- **Crisis**: October 1947 - Pakistan sent tribal infiltrators to capture Kashmir
- **Resolution**: Maharaja Hari Singh sought Indian help and acceded to Indian Union
- **Context**: Muslim majority areas in West and East joined Pakistan; J&K was exception

#### Article 370: Special Autonomy (Historical)
**Key Features** (before 2019):
- **Legislative Consent**: State concurrence required for Union and Concurrent list laws
- **Limited Central Powers**: Other powers required state government consent
- **Constitutional Orders**: President issued two orders with J&K government concurrence, making large Constitution parts applicable
- **Retained Differences**:
  - Separate state constitution and flag
  - No internal disturbance emergency without state concurrence
  - No Union financial emergency imposition
  - Directive Principles didn't apply
  - Constitutional amendments (Article 368) required state concurrence

#### Current Status (Post-2019)
**Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act 2019**:
- **Article 370**: Special status no longer exists
- **Bifurcation**: State divided into two Union Territories
  1. Jammu and Kashmir
  2. Ladakh
- **Effective Date**: October 31, 2019

---

# Chapter 8: Local Governments
## Indian Constitution at Work

---

## Introduction

In a democracy, it is not sufficient to have an elected government at the centre and at the State level. It is also necessary that even at the local level, there should be an elected government to look after local affairs. 

### Learning Objectives
After studying this chapter, you will know:
- The importance of local government bodies
- The provisions made by the 73rd and 74th amendments
- Functions and responsibilities of the local government bodies

---

## Why Local Governments?

### Inspiring Stories of Local Leadership

#### Geeta Rathore - Transformational Leadership
**Background:** Jamonia Talab Gram Panchayat, Sehore district, Madhya Pradesh

**Journey:**
- Elected Sarpanch in 1995 from a reserved seat
- Re-elected in 2000 from a non-reserved seat due to exceptional work
- Transformed from housewife to visionary leader

**Achievements:**
- Renovated water tanks
- Built school buildings
- Constructed village roads
- Fought against domestic violence and atrocities against women
- Created environmental awareness
- Encouraged afforestation and water management

*Source: Panchayati Raj Update, Vol. XI, No. 3, February 2004*

#### Vengaivasal Village Gram Panchayat - Legal Victory
**Background:** Tamil Nadu, 1997

**The Challenge:**
- Tamil Nadu government allotted two hectares of land to 71 government employees
- Land fell within Gram Panchayat jurisdiction
- District Collector directed Panchayat to endorse the allotment
- Panchayat refused and filed writ petition in Madras High Court

**Legal Journey:**
- Single judge bench upheld Collector's order
- Division bench reversed the single judge's order
- **Final Ruling:** Government order violated constitutional status of Panchayats

*Source: Panchayati Raj Update, Vol. XII, June 2005*

### Significance of These Stories

Both stories represent a larger transformation across India, especially after constitutional status was accorded to local government institutions in **1993**.

### Core Principles of Local Government

#### Definition and Scope
- **Local government** = Government at village and district level
- Government closest to common people
- Involves day-to-day life and problems of ordinary citizens
- Based on local knowledge and local interest for democratic decision-making

#### Key Advantages

**Accessibility:**
- Near to the people
- Convenient approach for problem-solving
- Quick solutions with minimum cost

**Effectiveness:**
- Protecting local interests (as seen in both case studies)
- Meaningful participation in democracy
- Ensuring accountability

#### Democratic Foundation

**Participation and Accountability:**
- Strong and vibrant local governments ensure active participation
- Purposeful accountability at grassroots level
- Common citizens involved in decision-making concerning their lives, needs, and development

**Fundamental Democratic Principle:**
> Tasks which can be performed locally should be left in the hands of local people and their representatives

**Why Local Government Strengthens Democracy:**
- People more familiar with local government than State or national level
- More concerned with local government actions due to direct impact
- Strengthening local government = strengthening democratic processes

---

## Growth of Local Government in India

### Historical Background

#### Ancient Foundations
- Self-governing village communities existed from earliest times
- Form of **'sabhas'** (village assemblies)
- Evolution into **Panchayats** (assembly of five persons)
- Resolved village-level issues with changing roles over time

#### Modern Development

**Lord Rippon's Initiative (1882):**
- Created first elected local government bodies
- Called **"local boards"**
- Slow progress led to Indian National Congress urging more effective measures

**Government of India Acts:**
- **1919:** Village panchayats established in several provinces
- **1935:** Trend continued

### Mahatma Gandhi's Vision

#### Decentralization Philosophy
> "The independence of India should mean the independence of the whole of India…Independence must begin at the bottom. Thus every village will be a republic... It follows therefore that every village has to be self-sustained and capable of managing its affairs. In this structure composed of innumerable villages, there will be ever-widening, ever-ascending circles. Life will be a pyramid with the apex sustained by the bottom"
> 
> *- Mahatma Gandhi*

**Key Beliefs:**
- Strengthening village panchayats = effective decentralisation
- All development initiatives must have local involvement
- Panchayats as instruments of decentralisation and participatory democracy
- Opposition to concentration of powers in Governor General at Delhi

### Constitutional Framework (1950)

#### Initial Provisions
- Local government assigned to **State List**
- Mentioned in **Directive Principles of State Policy**
- **Non-justiciable** and primarily advisory nature

#### Reasons for Limited Constitutional Importance

**Political Context:**
1. **Partition turmoil** resulted in strong unitary inclination
2. **Nehru's concern:** Extreme localism as threat to national unity and integration

**Social Concerns:**
- **Dr. B.R. Ambedkar's position:** Faction and caste-ridden rural society would defeat noble purposes
- Fear of factionalism and village-level social ills

**Constitutional Assembly Perspective:**
> "… in the interests of democracy, the villages maybe trained in the art of self-government, even autonomy... We must be able to reform the villages and introduce democratic principles of government there…"
> 
> *- Ananthasayanam Ayyangar, CAD, Vol. VII, p. 428, 17 November 1948*

### Local Governments in Independent India

#### Early Initiatives

**Community Development Programme (1952):**
- Promoted people's participation in local development
- Range of activities for rural development

## 73rd and 74th Amendments

### Background and Timeline

**1989:** Central government introduced two constitutional amendments
**1992:** 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments passed by Parliament
**1993:** Amendments came into force

### Objectives
- Strengthening local governments
- Ensuring uniformity in structure and functioning across the country

### International Example: Brazil's Model
> The Constitution of Brazil has created States, Federal Districts and Municipal Councils. Each of these is assigned independent powers and jurisdiction. Just as the Republic cannot interfere in the affairs of the States (except on grounds provided by the constitution), states are prohibited from interfering in the affairs of the municipal councils. This provision protects the powers of the local government.

### Constitutional Framework
- **73rd Amendment:** Rural local governments (Panchayati Raj Institutions - PRIs)
- **74th Amendment:** Urban local government (Nagarpalikas)
- **State Subject:** States free to make own laws, but must conform to constitutional amendments
- **Implementation Timeline:** States given one year to change laws accordingly

- Preparedness for genuine power-sharing
- **Democracy principle:** Power should be shared by people
- **Local empowerment:** Villages and urban localities must have policy and programme decision-making power

### Future Vision

**Democratic Decentralisation:**
- Democracy means decentralisation of power
- Giving more power to people at grassroots
- **Assessment criterion:** Practical implementation, not just legal framework

**Laws as Foundation:**
- Local government laws = important step toward democratisation
- **Success measure:** Translation of legal provisions into effective practice

# Chapter 9: Constitution as a Living Document

## Introduction

This chapter examines how the Indian Constitution has functioned over its 69-year existence and how India has been successfully governed under the same constitutional framework. 

### Key Learning Outcomes
After studying this chapter, you will understand that:
- The Indian Constitution can be amended according to changing needs
- Despite numerous amendments, the Constitution's basic premises remain unchanged
- The judiciary has played a crucial role in protecting and interpreting the Constitution
- The Constitution evolves continuously in response to changing situations

---

## Are Constitutions Static?

### International Constitutional Changes
Many nations frequently rewrite their constitutions due to:
- Changed circumstances
- Evolving societal ideas  
- Political upheavals

#### Examples of Constitutional Instability
**Soviet Union**: Four constitutions in 74 years (1918, 1924, 1936, 1977)
- Communist Party rule ended in 1991
- Soviet federation disintegrated
- Russian federation adopted new constitution in 1993

**France**: Multiple constitutions over two centuries
- Post-revolution constitution of 1793 (First French Republic)
- Second French Republic (1848)
- Third French Republic (1875)
- Fourth French Republic (1946)
- Fifth French Republic (1958)

#### United States Comparison
> "The Constitution of the US came into existence more than 200 years ago and so far it has been amended only 27 times!"

### India's Constitutional Continuity
**Adoption**: November 26, 1949
**Implementation**: January 26, 1950
**Duration**: Over 69 years of continuous operation under the same framework

### Why Has the Same Constitution Endured?

#### Quality and Foresight
- Robust constitutional framework well-suited to India
- Farsighted Constitution makers who anticipated future challenges
- Recognition that no constitution can provide for all eventualities

#### Flexibility and Adaptability
The Constitution's durability stems from:
1. **Acceptance of modification necessity** according to changing societal needs
2. **Flexibility in interpretation** during actual implementation
3. **Political and judicial maturity** in constitutional application

### Constitutional Characteristics

#### Contemporary vs. Durable Elements
Constitutions must balance:
- **Contemporary provisions**: Address current societal problems
- **Durable framework**: Provide governance structure for the future
- **Adaptive capacity**: Respond to unforeseen challenges

#### Sacred vs. Instrumental Nature
The Constitution makers addressed the fundamental question:
- Is the constitution so sacred that it can never be changed?
- Is it an ordinary instrument that can be modified like any law?

**Indian Solution**: Balance between both approaches
- Constitution placed above ordinary law
- Recognition that future modifications might be necessary
- Combination of sanctity and adaptability

---

## How to Amend the Constitution

### Constitutional Framework for Amendment

> **Article 368**: "Parliament may in exercise of its constituent power amend by way of addition, variation or repeal any provision of this Constitution in accordance with the procedure laid down in this article."

### Balancing Flexibility and Rigidity

The Constitution makers sought to make the Constitution:
- **Flexible**: Open to necessary changes
- **Rigid**: Resistant to unnecessary and frequent changes

#### Reasons for Different Amendment Procedures

1. **Error Correction**: Easy amendment of mistakes and faults
2. **Temporary Provisions**: Alteration of provisions meant to be changed later
3. **Federal Structure**: State consent required for changes affecting state powers
4. **Core Principles**: Protection of central constitutional features

### Three Methods of Amendment

#### Method 1: Simple Parliamentary Law
- **Application**: Specific articles mentioning amendment "by law"
- **Procedure**: Simple majority in Parliament
- **Examples**: 
  - Article 2: "Parliament may by law admit into the union... new states..."
  - Article 3: "Parliament may by law... increase the area of any state..."
- **Characteristic**: Very flexible, no special procedure required

#### Method 2: Special Majority in Parliament
- **Application**: Most constitutional amendments under Article 368
- **Requirements**:
  - Special majority in both Houses separately
  - No joint session provision
  - No referendum required
  - Presidential assent mandatory (no power to send back)

#### Method 3: Special Majority Plus State Ratification
- **Application**: Articles affecting federal structure and state representation
- **Requirements**:
  - Special majority in Parliament
  - Consent of half the state legislatures
  - Simple majority sufficient in state legislatures

### Special Majority Requirements

#### Definition and Calculation
Special majority requires BOTH:
1. **Absolute majority**: At least half of total House strength
2. **Two-thirds majority**: Two-thirds of members actually voting

#### Lok Sabha Example (545 members)
- Minimum support needed: 273 members
- If 300 members present: Still need 273 votes
- If 400 members vote: Need 267 votes (2/3 of 400)

#### Significance of Special Majority
- Forces consensus-building beyond simple party majorities
- Requires opposition party cooperation for constitutional changes
- Based on principle of broad political support

> **Dr. Ambedkar's Perspective**: "If those who are dissatisfied with the Constitution have only to obtain a 2/3 majority and if they cannot obtain even (that)..., their dissatisfaction with the Constitution cannot be deemed to be shared by the general public."

### State Ratification Process

#### When Required
- Amendments affecting distribution of powers between Centre and States
- Changes in representation arrangements
- Modifications to federal structure

#### Procedure
- Legislatures of half the states must pass the amendment bill
- Simple majority in state legislatures sufficient
- Respects federal principles while maintaining flexibility

### International Comparison of Amendment Procedures

#### Special Majority Principle
- **United States**: Two-thirds majority
- **South Africa**: Three-fourths majority (some amendments)
- **Russia**: Three-fourths majority (some amendments)

#### People's Participation Principle
- **Switzerland**: People can initiate amendments
- **Russia and Italy**: People initiate or approve amendments

---

## Why Have There Been So Many Amendments?

### Amendment Statistics
**As of January 12, 2019**: 103 amendments in 69 years

### Historical Patterns

#### Peak Amendment Periods
**1970-1990**: Highest concentration of amendments
- **1974-1976**: 10 amendments in 3 years (Congress dominance)
- **2001-2003**: 10 amendments in 3 years (coalition politics)

#### Political Context Analysis
Amendment frequency not dependent solely on:
- Nature of ruling party majority
- Single-party vs. coalition government
- Political stability or instability

### Classification of Amendments

#### Category 1: Technical/Administrative Amendments
**Characteristics**: Legal amendments with no substantial policy change

**Examples**:
- **15th Amendment**: Increased High Court judges' retirement age (60 to 62 years)
- **54th Amendment**: Increased judicial salaries
- **Reserved Seats Extensions**: Six amendments extending SC/ST reservations every 10 years
- **Presidential Powers Clarification**: Article 74(1) amendment making ministerial advice binding

#### Category 2: Interpretational Conflicts
**Context**: Parliament-Judiciary disagreements requiring constitutional clarification

**Major Issues (1970-1975)**:
- Relationship between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles
- Scope of right to private property
- Parliament's constitutional amendment powers

**Parliamentary Response**: Repeated amendments to overcome adverse judicial interpretations

#### Category 3: Political Consensus Amendments
**Context**: Cross-party agreement on necessary changes

**Post-1984 Examples**:
- **52nd and 91st Amendments**: Anti-defection measures
- **61st Amendment**: Reduced voting age from 21 to 18 years
- **73rd and 74th Amendments**: Panchayati Raj and Municipal governance
- **77th, 81st, 82nd Amendments**: Reservation clarifications and expansions

### Controversial Amendments (1970-1980)

#### Most Controversial Amendments
**38th, 39th, and 42nd Amendments**: Made during Internal Emergency (June 1975)

#### 42nd Amendment: "Mini Constitution"
**Extensive Changes**:
- Modified Preamble
- Changed Seventh Schedule
- Altered 53 constitutional articles
- Extended Lok Sabha term (5 to 6 years)
- Introduced Fundamental Duties
- Restricted judicial review powers

**Political Context**:
- Many opposition MPs imprisoned during passage
- Seen as constitutional subversion
- Override attempt of Kesavananda ruling

#### Constitutional Restoration
**1977 Elections**: Congress defeated
**43rd and 44th Amendments**: Cancelled most controversial changes, restored constitutional balance

---

## Basic Structure and Evolution of the Constitution

### Kesavananda Bharati Case (1973)

#### Basic Structure Theory Establishment
The Supreme Court's ruling established three key principles:
1. **Amendment Limitations**: No amendment can violate the Constitution's basic structure
2. **Parliamentary Powers**: Parliament can amend any constitutional part (within basic structure limits)
3. **Judicial Authority**: Supreme Court decides what constitutes basic structure and violations

### Impact on Constitutional Evolution

#### Formal vs. Informal Amendment
- **Formal Amendment**: Through Article 368 procedures
- **Informal Amendment**: Through judicial interpretation without formal process
- **Basic Structure Theory**: Example of informal constitutional evolution

#### Judicial Contributions to Constitutional Development

**Reservation Principles**:
- 50% ceiling on reservations in jobs and education
- "Creamy layer" concept for OBC reservations

**Rights Expansion**:
- Right to education interpretations
- Right to life and liberty expansions
- Minority educational institution management rights

### Constitutional Review Efforts

#### Venkatachaliah Commission (2000)
**Mandate**: Review entire Constitution's working
**Controversy**: Opposition parties and organizations boycotted
**Approach**: Adhered to basic structure theory, no recommendations endangering basic structure
**Significance**: Demonstrated basic structure doctrine's acceptance in constitutional practice

### Rigidity-Flexibility Balance
Basic structure doctrine enhanced constitutional balance:
- **Rigidity**: Certain parts cannot be amended
- **Flexibility**: All other parts remain amendable

---

## Constitution as a Living Document

### Living Constitution Concept

#### Dynamic Responsiveness
Like a living being, the Constitution:
- Responds to changing situations and circumstances
- Adapts through experience
- Remains open to interpretations
- Evolves with societal changes

#### Democratic Constitution Hallmarks
- Protection of democracy while allowing evolution
- Accommodation of new practices
- Durability through adaptability
- Citizen respect through effectiveness

### Critical Constitutional Questions

#### Parliamentary Supremacy vs. Constitutional Framework
**Parliamentary Democracy Principle**: Parliament represents people, should have upper hand
**Constitutional Framework**: Other organs have defined powers, rule of law must prevail

**Democratic Balance Requirements**:
- Votes and people's representation
- Rule of law principle
- Institutional development and cooperation
- Accountability to people
- Inter-institutional balance

### Judiciary's Constitutional Contribution

#### Balancing Competing Principles
**Parliament's Position**: Power to make pro-people laws and amendments
**Judiciary's Position**: All actions must occur within constitutional framework, legal procedures essential

#### Letter vs. Spirit Approach
**Basic Structure Innovation**:
- Not explicitly mentioned in Constitution text
- Judicial creation based on constitutional spirit
- Focus on document's intent over mere textual reading
- Balance between constitutional letter and spirit

> **Judicial Philosophy**: "A mere text of the law is less important than the social circumstances and aspirations that have produced that law or document."

### Political Leadership Maturity

#### Post-Kesavananda Developments
- Initial resistance through 42nd Amendment
- Minerva Mills Case (1980) reaffirmed basic structure
- Four decades of acceptance across political spectrum
- Constitutional review exercises respected basic structure limits

#### Shared Constitutional Vision
**Nehru's "Tryst with Destiny"**: Common vision of India's future
**Constituent Assembly Values**:
- Individual dignity and freedom
- Social and economic equality
- Universal well-being
- Unity based on national integrity

**Enduring Relevance**: Vision remains intact, ensuring constitutional respect and authority

### Democratic Politics and Constitutional Evolution

#### Healthy Democratic Characteristics
- Debates and differences as signs of diversity
- Political maturity in setting debate limits
- Compromise and give-and-take approaches
- Moderation of extreme positions
- Common minimum ground achievement

#### Inter-Governmental Competition
- Ongoing competition between government organs
- Disagreements over people's welfare definitions
- **Ultimate Authority**: People, their freedoms, and well-being

#### Constitutional Assembly Skepticism
> **Lakshminarayan Sahu (CAD, Vol. XI, p. 613, 17 November 1949)**: "The ideals on which this draft constitution is framed have no manifest relation to the fundamental spirit of India. ...this Constitution ...would not prove suitable and would break down soon after being brought into operation."

**Historical Verdict**: Constitution's 69+ year success contradicts these early doubts

---

## Conclusion

The Indian Constitution's success as a living document stems from its ability to balance stability with adaptability. Through formal amendments, judicial interpretations, and political maturity, it continues to serve as an effective framework for democratic governance while remaining responsive to changing societal needs.

**Key Success Factors**:
- Balanced amendment procedures
- Judicial wisdom in constitutional interpretation
- Political consensus on fundamental values
- Citizen respect for constitutional authority
- Flexibility within a stable framework

The Constitution remains not just a legal document but a living embodiment of India's democratic aspirations and values.

# Chapter 10: The Philosophy of the Constitution

## Learning Objectives

After reading this chapter, you should be able to understand:
- Why it is important to study the philosophy of the Constitution
- What are the core features of the Indian Constitution
- What are the criticisms of this Constitution
- What are the limitations of the Constitution

---

## Introduction: Why Study Constitutional Philosophy?

The chapter addresses fundamental questions about India's Constitution:

**Key Questions:**
- Why did independence leaders feel the need to adopt a constitution after achieving freedom from British rule?
- Why did they choose to bind themselves and future generations to a constitution?
- What kind of constitution have we given ourselves?
- What objectives did we hope to achieve by it?
- Do these objectives have moral content?

---

## What is Meant by Philosophy of the Constitution?

### Beyond Legal Framework

Some people believe that a constitution merely consists of laws and that laws are one thing, values and morality quite another. However, many laws are closely connected to our deeply held values.

**Example:** A law prohibiting discrimination based on language or religion is connected to the idea of equality. Such a law exists because we value equality.

### Political Philosophy Approach

The Constitution must be viewed as a document based on a certain moral vision. A political philosophy approach to the constitution involves three key elements:

#### 1. Understanding Conceptual Structure
- What are the possible meanings of terms used in the constitution?
- Key terms: 'rights', 'citizenship', 'minority', 'democracy'

#### 2. Coherent Vision Development
- Work out a coherent vision of society and polity
- Better grasp the set of ideals embedded in the constitution

#### 3. Integration with Constituent Assembly Debates
- Read the Constitution in conjunction with Constituent Assembly Debates
- Refine and raise to a higher theoretical plane the justification of values
- Provide detailed justification for constitutional values

### Importance of Political Philosophy Approach

**Functions:**
- Find out the moral content expressed in the Constitution
- Evaluate its claims
- Arbitrate between varying interpretations of core values
- Address conflicts when the same ideal is interpreted differently by different institutions

**Contemporary Relevance:**
Constitutional ideals are challenged, discussed, debated and contested in different political arenas - legislatures, party forums, press, schools and universities. These ideals are variously interpreted and sometimes willfully manipulated to suit partisan short-term interests.

---

## Constitution as Means of Democratic Transformation

### Restricting Exercise of Power

Modern states are excessively powerful with monopoly over force and coercion. Constitutions provide basic rules to prevent states from turning tyrannical.

### Peaceful Democratic Transformation

Constitutions provide peaceful, democratic means to bring about social transformation. For a hitherto colonized people, constitutions announce and embody the first real exercise of political self-determination.

### Nehru's Vision

**Constituent Assembly Significance:**
> "The demand for a Constituent Assembly represented a collective demand for full self-determination because only a Constituent Assembly of elected representatives of the Indian people had the right to frame India's constitution without external interference."

**Transformative Purpose:**
> "The Constituent Assembly is not just a body of people or a gathering of able lawyers. Rather, it is 'a nation on the move, throwing away the shell of its past political and possibly social structure, and fashioning for itself a new garment of its own making.'"

The Indian Constitution was designed to break the shackles of traditional social hierarchies and usher in a new era of freedom, equality and justice.

### Revolutionary Approach to Constitutional Democracy

This approach changed the theory of constitutional democracy: constitutions exist not only to limit people in power but to empower those who traditionally have been deprived of it. Constitutions can give vulnerable people the power to achieve collective good.

---

## Why Return to the Constituent Assembly?

### Relevance of Historical Context

Unlike America, where the constitution was written in the late 18th century, in India the world of the original framers and our present-day world may not have changed so drastically. In terms of values, ideals and conception, we have not separated ourselves from the world of the Constituent Assembly.

**Key Insight:** A history of our Constitution is still very much a history of the present.

### Recovering Lost Principles

We may have forgotten the real point underlying several legal and political practices simply because we began to take them for granted. When these practices are challenged or threatened, neglect of underlying principles can be harmful.

**Therefore:** To grasp current constitutional practice and their value and meaning, we must revisit the Constituent Assembly debates and even the colonial era.

---

## The Political Philosophy of Our Constitution

### Multi-Faceted Nature

The philosophy resists any single label because it is:
- Liberal
- Democratic
- Egalitarian
- Secular
- Federal
- Open to community values
- Sensitive to needs of religious and linguistic minorities
- Sensitive to historically disadvantaged groups
- Committed to building common national identity

**Core Commitment:** Freedom, equality, social justice, and some form of national unity, with clear emphasis on peaceful and democratic measures.

**Democratic Foundation:** While all ideas unfold on this playfield, democracy is the 'Umpire'.

---

## Core Features and Achievements

### 1. Individual Freedom

#### Historical Development
The commitment to individual freedom emerged from continuous intellectual and political activity over more than a century.

**Early Example:** Rammohan Roy (early 19th century) protested against curtailment of freedom of press by British colonial state, arguing that a state responsive to individual needs must provide means for communication.

#### Constitutional Expression
- Freedom of expression is integral to the Indian Constitution
- Freedom from arbitrary arrest (response to infamous Rowlatt Act)
- Freedom of conscience
- These freedoms reflect the liberal ideology of the Constitution

**Historical Context:** For over forty years before adoption of the Constitution, every single resolution, scheme, bill and report of the Indian National Congress mentioned individual rights as a non-negotiable value.

### 2. Social Justice

#### Distinctive Indian Liberalism

The liberalism of the Indian Constitution differs from classical western liberalism in two ways:

**Difference from Classical Liberalism:**
Classical liberalism always privileges rights of individuals over demands of social justice and community values.

#### Integration with Social Justice
Indian constitutional liberalism was always linked to social justice.

**Primary Example:** Provisions for reservations for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes

**Rationale:** Constitution makers believed that mere granting of right to equality was not enough to overcome age-old injustices or give real meaning to voting rights. Special constitutional measures were required.

**Special Measures Provided:**
- Reservation of seats in legislatures
- Reservation of public sector jobs
- Various protective measures

#### Historical Context of Indian Liberalism

> "Indian liberalism has two streams. The first stream began with Rammohan Roy. He emphasised individual rights, particularly the rights of women. The second stream included thinkers like K.C. Sen, Justice Ranade and Swami Vivekananda. They introduced the spirit of social justice within orthodox Hinduism. For Vivekananda, such a reordering of Hindu society could not have been possible without liberal principles." - K.M. Panikkar, In Defence of Liberalism

### 3. Respect for Diversity and Minority Rights

#### The Challenge
The Constitution encourages equal respect between communities, which was challenging because:
- Communities don't always have relationships of equality (hierarchical relationships as in caste)
- When communities see each other as equals, they tend to become rivals (religious communities)

#### Constitutional Solution
Rather than not recognizing communities at all (as most western liberal constitutions do), the Indian Constitution openly acknowledged the value of communities.

**Reasons for Recognition:**
- India is a land of multiple cultural communities
- Unlike Germany or France, we have several linguistic and religious communities
- Important to ensure no one community systematically dominates others
- Made it mandatory to recognize community-based rights

**Example:** Right of religious communities to establish and run their own educational institutions, which may receive government funding.

**Significance:** The Indian Constitution does not see religion merely as a 'private' matter concerning individuals.

### 4. Secularism

#### Understanding Secular States
Secular states are widely seen as treating religion as only a private matter, refusing to give religion public or official recognition.

#### Western Conception of Secularism
**Mutual Exclusion:** Both religion and state must stay away from internal affairs of one another.
- State must not intervene in domain of religion
- Religion should not dictate state policy or influence state conduct
- Strict separation between religion and state

**Purpose:** To safeguard freedom of individuals by preventing states from making religious organizations more powerful and preventing religious organizations from controlling individual religious lives.

#### Indian Model of Secularism

Conditions in India required an alternative conception of secularism, departing from the western model in two ways:

##### Rights of Religious Groups
**Inter-community Equality:** As necessary as equality between individuals because a person's freedom and self-respect was directly dependent upon status of their community.

**Constitutional Provision:** Rights to all religious communities, such as right to establish and maintain educational institutions.

**Principle:** Freedom of religion in India means freedom of religion of both individuals and communities.

##### State's Power of Intervention
**Beyond Mutual Exclusion:** Separation in India could not mean mutual exclusion because religiously sanctioned customs such as untouchability deprived individuals of basic dignity and self-respect.

**Necessity of State Intervention:** Such customs were so deeply rooted and pervasive that without active state intervention, there was no hope of dissolution.

**Flexible Approach:** The state may help or hinder religious communities depending on which mode of action promotes values such as freedom and equality.

**Principled Distance:** A complex idea that allows the state to be distant from all religions so that it can intervene or abstain from interference, depending upon which would better promote liberty, equality and social justice.

### 5. Universal Franchise

#### Significant Achievement
Committing to universal franchise was remarkable, especially when:
- There was widespread belief that traditional hierarchies in India were congealed and impossible to eliminate
- Right to vote had only recently been extended to women and working class in stable Western democracies

#### Historical Development
**Connection to Nationalism:** Once the idea of nation took root among the elite, the idea of democratic self-government followed. Indian nationalism always conceived of political order based on will of every single member of society.

**Early Recognition:** As early as the Constitution of India Bill (1895), the first non-official attempt at drafting a constitution for India declared that every citizen had a right to participate in country's affairs and be admitted to public office.

**Motilal Nehru Report (1928):** Reaffirmed this conception, stating that every person of either sex who attained age twenty-one was entitled to vote.

#### Constitutional Assembly's Faith

> "The Assembly has adopted the principle of adult franchise with an abundant faith in the common man and the ultimate success of democratic rule and in the full belief that the introduction of democratic government on the basis of adult suffrage will... promote the well-being..." - Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar, CAD, Vol. XI, November 23, 1949

### 6. Federalism

#### Asymmetric Federalism
The Indian Constitution anticipates the important concept of asymmetric federalism through Article 371 concerning North-East.

**Key Features:**
- Strong central government with unitary bias
- Important constitutionally embedded differences between legal status and prerogatives of different sub-units
- Unlike constitutional symmetry of American federalism, Indian federalism has been constitutionally asymmetric

#### Special Provisions
**Article 371A (Nagaland):**
- Confers validity on pre-existing laws within Nagaland
- Protects local identity through restrictions on immigration
- Many other states are beneficiaries of such special provisions

**Multi-lingual Federation:**
- Each major linguistic group is politically recognized
- All are treated as equals
- Democratic and linguistic federalism combines claims to unity with claims to cultural recognition
- Robust political arena allows for play of multiple identities that complement one another

### 7. National Identity

#### Balancing Multiple Identities
The Constitution constantly reinforces common national identity while retaining regional identities. Common national identity was not incompatible with distinct religious or linguistic identities.

#### Rejection of Separate Electorates
**Rationale:** Separate electorates based on religious identity were rejected not because they fostered difference between religious communities or endangered simple notion of national unity, but because they endangered healthy national life.

**Goal:** Rather than forced unity, the Constitution sought to evolve true fraternity, a goal dear to Dr. Ambedkar's heart.

> "But in the long run, it would be in the interest of all to forget that there is anything like majority or minority in this country and that in India there is only one community..." - Sardar Patel, CAD, Vol. VIII, May 25, 1949

## Procedural Achievements

### 1. Faith in Political Deliberation

**Inclusive Approach:** Despite many groups and interests not being adequately represented in Constituent Assembly, debates show makers wanted to be as inclusive as possible.

**Key Indicators:**
- Willingness to modify existing preferences
- Justify outcomes by reference to reasons, not self-interest
- Recognition of creative value in difference and disagreement

### 2. Spirit of Compromise and Accommodation

**Positive Compromise:** Not all compromises are bad. When one value is partially traded off for another value in an open process of free deliberation among equals, the compromise can hardly be objected to.

**Moral Commendability:** 
- Securing a bit of all things important cannot be morally blameworthy
- Commitment to consensual decisions rather than majority vote on most important issues is morally commendable

## Criticisms of the Constitution

### 1. Unwieldy Nature

**Criticism:** The Constitution is too large and cumbersome.

**Response:** This criticism assumes the entire constitution must be found in one compact document. However:
- Even countries like the US with compact constitutions have other written documents with constitutional status
- Many constitutional details, practices and statements exist outside compact documents
- In India, many such details are included in one single document, making it large
- Many countries don't include provisions for election commission or civil service commission in their constitutional document, but India does

### 2. Unrepresentative Character

**Criticism:** The Constituent Assembly was formed without adult franchise, with most members from advanced sections of society.

#### Two Components of Representation

**Voice Component:** People must be recognized in their own language, not in language of masters.
- From this dimension, the Constitution is indeed unrepresentative due to restricted franchise

**Opinion Component:** Almost every shade of opinion was represented in Constituent Assembly.
- Members raised matters based on individual social concerns and perceived interests of various social sections
- Reading Constituent Assembly debates shows vast range of issues and opinions were mentioned

**Symbolic Representation:** The central square of many small towns has a statue of Dr. Ambedkar with a copy of the Indian Constitution, expressing Dalit feeling that the Constitution reflects many of their aspirations.

### 3. Alien Document Allegation

**Criticism:** The Indian Constitution is entirely borrowed from western constitutions and sits uneasily with Indian cultural ethos.

#### Constitutional Assembly Concern

> "...we wanted the music of Veena or Sitar, but here we have the music of an English band. That was because our constitution makers were educated that way... That is exactly the kind of Constitution Mahatma Gandhi did not want and did not envisage." - K. Hanumanthaiya, CAD, Vol. XI, November 17, 1949

#### Response to Criticism

**Innovative Borrowing:** While the Constitution is modern and partly western, it was never blind borrowing but innovative borrowing.

**Cultural Integration:**

**1. Adoption by Indians:** Many Indians not only adopted modern ways of thinking but made these their own. Westernization became a form of protest against problems in their own tradition.
- Rammohan Roy started this trend
- Continued to this day by Dalits
- As early as 1841, Dalit people of northern India effectively used newly introduced legal system to bring suits against landlords

**2. Hybrid Culture:** When western modernity interacted with local cultural systems, a hybrid culture emerged through creative adaptation.
- This created an alternative modernity with character different from both western modernity and indigenous tradition
- When drafting the Constitution, efforts were made to amalgamate western and traditional Indian values
- Process of selective adaptation, not borrowing

## Limitations of the Constitution

Despite its achievements, the Constitution has limitations:

### 1. Centralized National Unity
The Indian Constitution has a centralized idea of national unity.

### 2. Gender Justice Issues
It appears to have glossed over some important issues of gender justice, particularly within the family.

### 3. Socio-Economic Rights
It is unclear why in a poor developing country, certain basic socio-economic rights were relegated to Directive Principles rather than made integral features of Fundamental Rights.

**Important Note:** While it's possible to give answers to these limitations or overcome them, they are not serious enough to jeopardize the philosophy of the Constitution.

## Conclusion: Living Document

### Core Vision Embodiment

The Constitution gives expression to the philosophy adopted by society. The institutional arrangements studied throughout the book are based on a core and commonly agreed vision that historically emerged through the struggle for independence.

### Constituent Assembly as Platform

The Constituent Assembly was the platform on which this vision was stated, refined and articulated in legal-institutional form, making the Constitution the embodiment of this vision.

### Preamble as Summary

The best summary of the philosophy of the Constitution is found in the Preamble, which makes a humble claim: the Constitution is not 'given' by a body of great men but is prepared and adopted by 'We, the people of India...'.

**Democratic Principle:** The people are themselves the makers of their own destinies, and democracy is the instrument people have used for shaping their present and future.

### Enduring Vision

More than five decades since the Constitution was drafted:
- We have fought over many matters
- Courts and governments have disagreed on interpretations
- Centre and States have differences of opinion
- Political parties have fought bitterly
- Politics has been full of problems and shortcomings

**Yet:** Every politician and common citizen continues to share in the vision embodied in the Constitution: we want to live together and prosper together on the basis of principles of equality, liberty and fraternity.

### Historical Significance

**1950:** Making this Constitution was a great achievement.
**Today:** Keeping alive the philosophical vision of that Constitution may be our important achievement.
